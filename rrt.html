The laccase/TEMPO system was employed to oxidise the C6 primary hydroxyl group on the chitosan (CS) to form
a carboxyl group to obtain oxidised chitosan (C-COS). The silver-oxidised chitosan complex(C-COS-Ag) was
prepared by reacting C-COS with silver nitrate, then C-COS-Ag and cotton fibres were subjected to a reaction to
prepare bacteriostatic fibres. FT-IR and XPS analysis showed that: Ag+ and C-COS were combined in these forms:
Ag, [Ag(NH3)2] OH, -COOAg, and Ag2O. C-COS-Ag was combined with cotton fibres by way of ester bonds. The
inhibition zone of bacteriostatic fibres was all greater than 11 mm. After 50 washing tests, the bacteriostatic
effect of bacteriostatic fibres remained at above 99 %. The amount of silver ions that had migrated from the
bacteriostatic fibre was 3.336 mg/kg.

1. Introduction
The production and development undertaken as a core function of
human society are closely related to bacteria. For example, there are
about five million bacteria per square centimetre on human clothing and
100,000–1 million bacteria per square centimetre on human skin
(Cockburn et al., 2013; Jiang & Zhang, 2008; Dobrijevic, Abraham,
Jamet, Maguin, & van de Guchte, 2016). When inflammation occurs on
human skin, or when sensitive skin comes into contact with these bac­
teria, human infections can lead to even more serious consequences.
Therefore, the preparation of highly effective bacteriostatic fibres has
gradually become a focus for research (Ito et al., 2014). Among them,
silver-based bacteriostatic fibres are the most effective in terms of
bacteriostasis. At present, there are many methods for preparing
silver-based bacteriostatic fibres, composite spinning technology and
physical deposition are the most widely used (Hipler, Elsner, & Fluhr,
2006).
Composite spinning technology, that is, the use of fibres containing
bacteriostatic components and fibres without bacteriostatic components
or other fibres for composite spinning to make side-by-side, core-sheath,
inlay, or hollow multi-core bacteriostatic fibres (Aziz, Abu, & Chong,
2012; Jiang et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2005; Wang, Zhang, Yin, Wang, &
Dong, 2010) is now widely used. An bacteriostatic fibre with a skin-core
structure distributed bacteriostatic agents on the surface of the material,
which optimises the contact surface with harmful bacteria (Foss

Manufacturing Co Inc., 2004, Hugo & Bloomfield, 1971). The physical
deposition method, whereby, silver nanoparticles are deposited on the
surface of the fibre film to form a metal film, imparts an bacteriostatic
effect to the fibre (Booshehri, Wang, & Xu, 2013; Roy, Knapp, Guthrie, &
Perrier, 2008). When the silver content is decreased due to the leaching
of silver, silver particles can be easily separated from the membrane
surface for replenishment, maintaining good bacteriostatic properties
while extending the useful service life of the product (Damm & Mun­
stedt, 2008; Halkai, Mudda, Shivanna, Rathod, & Halkai, 2018).
Although the above two types of bacteriostatic fibres have good bacte­
riostatic properties, they have common defects. That is to say, the
bacteriostatic fibres prepared by these two methods only adsorb silver
particles on the fibres by electrostatic action, the fastness effect is not
good, and the bacteriostatic agent easily dissolves off the fibre surface
(Ozdemir, Ozguney, Kantar, & Sasmaz, 2017). If the fibres are used in
textiles, silver ions may migrate to the skin and result in serious injury
(Maidaniuc et al., 2016).
Therefore, in this work, a new method was used for preparing silverbased bacteriostatic fibres which combines silver ions on the fibre by
chemical bonding, avoiding the migration of silver ions to harm the
human body. The laccase/TEMPO co-oxygenation system was used to
selectively oxidise the primary hydroxyl group at position C6 of chitosan
(CS) leading to oxidised chitosan (C-COS) (Bu et al., 2018; Pei, Yin,
Shen, Bu, & Zhang, 2016; Zhen et al., 2019). Then, C-COS-Ag, with
excellent bacteriostatic properties, was prepared by the reaction of silver

nitrate and C-COS. In addition to the coordination reaction between the
amino group and Ag+ in C-COS, some part of the C6-OOH will also
participate in the reaction, which, in relative terms, increases the
amount of binding between Ag+ and C-COS. The prepared bacteriostatic
agent solution and cotton fibre are then subjected to a reaction, so that
the bacteriostatic agent and the fibre are combined in the form of an
ester bond, as shown in Fig. 1, which enhances the firmness of the
bacteriostatic agent combination and prevents excessive deposition of
Ag+ on the skin and avoids the concomitant harm.

2.4. Preparation of bacteriostatic fibres
C-COS-Ag (0.04 g) was dissolved in acetate buffer (pH 4.6). Cotton
fibres were extracted by using phenol to remove fat, wax, and other
substances. The cotton fibre was extracted and placed in the C-COS-Ag
solution. The reaction temperature was set to between 50 and 60 ◦ C.
Concentrated sulphuric acid was slowly added to the reaction solution to
maintain the temperature and the reaction allowed to continue thus for
1 h (the reaction therefore proceeded in the forward direction). The
reaction product of C-COS-Ag and cotton fibre was defined as the
bacteriostatic fibre. After the reaction, the unreacted silver ions on the
surface of the bacteriostatic fibre are washed off for further analysis and
characterization.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials

2.5. Instrumental analysis methods

Cotton pulp fibres were purchased from Sun Paper Co., Ltd (Shan­
dong, China). CS (above 80 % degree of deacetylation, relative molec­
ular weight ≈ 50,000) was provided by Macleans Corporation. Laccase
was provided by Novozymes (Product No: NOVOZYME 51003). 2, 2, 6,
6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Escherichia coli Jrr109(E. coli), Staphylo­
coccus aureus Tccc11559 (S. aureus), Bacillus subtilis WB600(B. subtilis),
and Salmonella enteritidis Tccc111089 (S. enteritidis) were provided by
Tianjin University of Science and Technology. KBr and AgNO3 were of
analytical grade.

2.5.1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) detection
FTIR spectra ware recorded on a VERTEX 70 Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (Brook Optics, Germany). The wavelength range was 4000
cm− 1. The KBr compression method was used, and the mass ratio of the
sample to KBr was 1: 100.
2.5.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) detection
ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to
analyse the valence state of silver ion binding in C-COS-Ag.
2.5.3. Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) detection
The ssNMR nuclear magnetic resonance was measured by a JNMECZ600R nuclear magnetic resonance instrument (Japan Electronics
Corporation). Main configuration consists of: one 0.75 mm HX solid
state probe (latest ultra-high speed probe, highest domestic speed), one
1 mm HX solid state probe, two 3.2 mm HX solid state probes, one 8 mm
HX solid state probe (one with standard low-frequency accessories, one
custom W138 low-frequency accessory), one 3.2 mm HXY solid probe
and its accessory, with a resolution of 15 kHz. Sampling conditions were
set to: a 30◦ pulse sequence, a contact time of 2 ms, a relaxation time of 3
s, a sampling time of 1 h, and a cumulative number of scans of 1000.

2.2. Preparation of oxidised chitosan C-COS
CS (2 g), laccase (215 U), and TEMPO (0.08 g) were dissolved in
acetate buffer (pH 4.6) and solution was stirred at 30 ◦ C under oxygen
bubbling for 18 h. After the reaction was complete, the excess water was
removed by rotary evaporation, and white precipitates were precipi­
tated with 200 mL of ethanol. The precipitates were filtered by suction
with a 0.22-μm filter membrane. The excess TEMPO was washed with
ethanol several times. The solid obtained by filtration was transferred to
a Petri dish, and then vacuum-dried at 40 ◦ C for 24 h. The dried sample
was stored in a desiccator and was labelled “C-COS”.

2.5.4. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) detection
Scanning electron microscope (JSM-IT300LV, JEOL) was used to
observe the changes in the morphology of bacteria on cotton fibres and
bacteriostatic fibres. Before observation, the surface of the dried sample
was spray-coated with gold to provide the requisite conductivity.

2.3. Preparation of bacteriostatic agent C-COS-Ag
C-COS was dissolved in acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer solution,
then 50 mL of 0.01 mol/L silver nitrate solution was added thereto. This
reaction occurred in a magnetic stirrer at 26 ◦ C for 1 h. After the reac­
tion, the reaction solution was precipitated into a milky white precipi­
tate with acetone to obtain solid products (Chen, Wu, & Zeng, 2005).
This solid was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and then washed with
ethanol multiple times to remove the free Ag+ on the surface of the
complex. After a while, the ethanol was volatilised. Thereafter, it was
dried under vacuum at 40 ◦ C to obtain C-COS-Ag.

2.5.5. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
detection
ICP-OES was used to detect the concentration of silver ions in the
solution with high accuracy (Javanbakht, Rudbaraki, Sohrabi, Attaran,
& Badiei, 2010). First, a silver ion standard solution was configured at
different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/L), while the

solvent used was 2 % HNO3. The sample was prepared from an bacte­

(colony forming units per millilitre). The absorbance of the bacteria in
the sample solution was measured at 600 nm using a Ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis). The percentage reduction of bacteria in the
sample can be calculated. The result was evaluated in terms of bacte­
riostatic effect using Eq. (1) (Kucuk, Balci, & Tutak, 2016; Sherif, Khalil,
Hegazi, Khalil, & Moharram, 2017).

2.5.6. Bacteriostatic test detection
The bacteriostatic fibre was made into a paper sheet having a
diameter of 6 mm. E. coli, S. aureus, S. enteritidis, and B. subtilis were used
as templates for the bacteriostatic bacteria. The sterilised culture me­
dium was cooled to 50 ◦ C, and then poured into the plate. The bacterial
solution was diluted 10-fold to obtain bacterial suspensions by gradual
dilution. The standardised density of the bacterial suspension was 2 ×
108 CFU/mL (colony forming units per millilitre). After the agar plate
was solidified, the bacterial suspension (200 u L) was sucked into the LB
solid medium for coating. A coating rod was utilised to spread the
bacterial solution evenly on the plate. Sterile forceps were used to press
the bacteriostatic fibre and cotton fibre evenly onto the agar medium, so
that the fibres and the medium were in intimate contact. After the test
sample was placed on the agar medium, it was immediately incubated
therein at 37 ◦ C in a bacterial incubator for 24 h. The bacterial repro­
duction could be observed thereafter (Takai et al., 2002).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. FTIR analysis
In order to detect the carboxyl group in C-COS, the mode of Ag+
combination in C-COS-Ag and the combination between C-COS-Ag and
cotton fibre, FTIR was used (Fig. 2).
As shown in Fig. 2a, CS presents the strong peak of the stretching
vibration of N–H and O–H due to hydrogen bonding association at
3450 cm− 1. The absorption peak of the amide II (–NH2) band was seen
at 1562 cm− 1 along with stretching vibration peaks of C–O in the
polysaccharide structure at 1031 cm− 1 and 1081 cm− 1, and these all
showed the characteristic absorption band of CS; however, C-COS
– O stretching vibration peak at
exhibited an obvious carboxylate C–
1646 cm− 1 (Bu et al., 2018), therefore, infrared spectroscopy showed
that CS had been oxidised to introduce carboxyl groups into its mole­
cules by the laccase/TEMPO system. The oxidation substitution degree
of C-6 OH can refer to Fig. S1.
– O stretching vibration peak
As shown in Fig. 2b, the carboxylate C–
area at 1657 cm− 1 corresponding to C-COS-Ag was found to be smaller
than that of C-COS, because Ag+ was reacted with the carboxyl group. In
addition, the absorption peaks of C-COS-Ag compared to C-COS at 1024
cm− 1, 1076 cm− 1, and 3320 cm− 1 were significantly enhanced. These

2.5.7. Washing durability detection
The washing procedure was carried out in accordance with Japanese
Standard JIS L0217. A bath ratio of 30:1 was used, and the washing bath
contained 2 g/L detergent(White cat laundry detergent). One washing
cycle was performed at 37 ◦ C for 10 min. One cycle later, the sample was
removed and rinsed in distilled water. After excess water in the sample
was lightly blotted with a dry towel, the next washing operation was
performed.
The bacteriostatic fibre was put into a liquid medium that had been
inoculated in bacterial suspension. The sample solution was incubated
in a shaking incubator at 37 ◦ C for 12 h. The bacterial solution was
diluted 10-fold to obtain bacterial suspensions by gradual dilution. The
standardised density of bacteria suspension was 2 × 108 CFU/mL

cotton fibres and –OOH on C-COS-Ag. Therefore, through infrared
spectroscopic analysis, it can be found that the combination of bacte­
riostatic agents and fibres in bacteriostatic fibres was present in the form
of ester bonds (Gardebjer et al., 2015).
3.2. XPS analysis
In order to further verify the manner of Ag+ binding in C-COS-Ag, CCOS-Ag was analysed by XPS to obtain the XPS graph of Ag3d, and then
the form of existence of Ag+ was acquired through spectrogram fitting.
The results are illustrated in Fig. 3.
As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the binding energy of N 1s in the COS
sample was 399.5 eV, while the binding energy of the C-COS-Ag sample
in N 1s was 398.8 eV, which was smaller than the binding energy of COS,
indicating that a coordination reaction of -NH2 on the C-COS surface had
occurred (Chen et al., 2005). The binding energy of Ag 3d 5/2 in the
C-COS-Ag sample was 368.0 eV, while the binding energy of Ag and
Ag2O was 368.2 eV, implying that Ag and Ag2O were present in the
C-COS-Ag sample. The reason for this may be that silver ions were
reduced during the in-situ polymerisation reaction to form silver, and
Ag+ was physically adsorbed on the surface of COS forming Ag2O
through contact with oxygen in the air. Compared with C-COS-Ag, the
binding energy of O1 s changed significantly in COS, showing that
-COOH on the surface of C-COS may have reacted with Ag+. The main
forms of Ag+ in the C-COS-Ag bacteriostatic agent were Ag, [Ag(NH3)2]
OH, -COOAg, and Ag2O. Therefore, silver ions in C-COS-Ag were mainly
present as Ag(0) and Ag(+1), and by calculating the peak area, the ratio
of the amounts of these two forms was 6:4.

three absorption peaks represent the symmetrical stretching vibration of
the carboxylate and the C–O stretching vibration and new hydrogen
bonding effect, which also explained the bonding between the carboxyl
group and Ag+. A strong peak representing the stretching vibration of
N–H and OH– due to the association of hydrogen bonds could be seen
at 3320 cm− 1. Compared with C-COS, the peak area of C-COS-Ag was
significantly broadened. The amide II (–NH2) band absorption peak
could be seen at 1564 cm− 1. This was because of the coordination re­
action between the amino group and Ag+ (Ma, Zhou, & Zhao, 2008;
Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore, infrared spectroscopy can indirectly
prove that the carboxyl group of C-COS reacted with Ag+, and the amino
group also reacted with Ag+.
As shown in Fig. 2c, the absorption peaks at 3400 cm− 1 and 2900
− 1
cm represented the stretching vibration of –OH in the hydroxyl group
and the absorption peak generated by the symmetrical stretching vi­
bration of CH2 on the glucopyranose ring (Guarin, Gavila, Constanti, &
Medina, 2018). The absorption peak at 1170 cm− 1 was attributed to the
asymmetric stretching vibration of –COC in the aromatic ring skeleton
vibration. The β-pyranoside bond vibration absorption peak was seen at
902 cm− 1 (Fraschini & Vignon, 2000). These peaks were characteristic
absorption peaks of cellulose. Meanwhile, a very obvious absorption
peak could be found at 1747 cm− 1, which was a characteristic peak
arising from the ester bond formed by the reaction between –OH on

3.3. ssNMR analysis
In order to further verify whether the cotton fibre and C-COS-Ag
were connected by ester bonds, a JNM-ECZ600R nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer (JEOL, Japan) was used to demonstrate the
cotton fibre and bacteriostatic fibres (Fig. 4).
As shown in Fig. 4, cotton fibre chemical shifts at δ: 72.07,
77.37–79.82, 91.43, and 104.46 were derived from C6, C2, 3, 5, C4, and
C1 (Gast, Atalla, & Mckelvey, 1980). A new vibration peak appeared in
the low-field region of the bacteriostatic fibre in the range of 155–170,
and this peak corresponded to the chemical shift peak of the ester bonds
(Xiao et al., 2012). This indicated that the hydroxyl group on cotton
fibre reacted with the carboxyl group on C-COS-Ag to form ester bonds.
In addition, the area of the C6 primary hydroxyl resonance peak of the
glucosamine ring at δ = 72.07 of cotton fibre samples became wider,
which further confirmed that the C6 primary hydroxyl group and
C-COS-Ag on cotton fibres formed ester bonds.

morphology of cotton fibres before and after being treated with C-COSAg (Fig. 5A and B), the cotton fibres and bacteriostatic fibres were
sprayed with gold and observed under a scanning electron microscope,
and the pictures are shown in Fig. 5.
As can be seen from Fig. 5A, the cotton fibre had a twisted flat belt
shape in the longitudinal direction, and the fibre surface was smooth and
shiny. The bacteria in these cotton fibres multiplied. Fig. 5B showed that
cotton fibres treated with antimicrobial agents, and phenol-extracted
cotton fibres removed resin, fat, wax, and other substances, while
destroying the hydrogen bond stability of the hydroxyl groups formed in
the cellulose crystalline region. Cotton fibres exposed more free hy­
droxyl groups (Ibarra et al., 2015), which increased the possibility of the
hydroxyl groups on cotton fibres reacting with the carboxyl groups in
C-COS-Ag. The morphology of the bacteria on the bacteriostatic fibre
had changed significantly. The bacteria became longer, the cell wall had
been damaged, the adhesion between the bacteria had increased, and
the cell wall had been broken or shrunk, which impaired the bacterial
reproduction and growth. More SEM pictures of bacteria on cotton fibres
and bacteriostatic fibres are provided in Fig. S2.

3.5. Analysis of bacteriostatic test
To test the bacteriostasis of the bacteriostatic fibres, the paper con­
taining the bacteriostatic fibres was placed on a solid medium coated
with bacterial solution, and the size of the bacteriostatic circle was
observed to evaluate the bacteriostatic performance (Nangmenyi, Li,
Mehrabi, Mintz, & Economy, 2011). The results are illustrated in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6, the cotton fibre treated with CS had the smallest
bacteriostatic circle, and was also covered with bacteria on the edge of
the round paper, indicating that it had little bacteriostatic effect (Zheng
& Zhu, 2003; Li, Wu, & L., 2016). The diameter of the bacteriostatic zone

of bacteriostatic fibres against all four kinds of bacteria exceeded 11
mm. Among them, the bacteriostatic fibre had the best bacteriostatic
effect against S. aureus, for which the diameter of the bacteriostatic zone
reached 14 mm.

OES showed that the amount of silver ions migrating from the bacte­
riostatic fibre after washing was 3.336 mg/kg, which was far below the
upper limit for textiles for heavy metals. The bacteriostatic rate of the
bacteriostatic fibre after 50 water-washing cycles remained above 99.8
%, indicating that the self-made bacteriostatic fibre had excellent
washing performance. The combination of bacteriostatic agent and fibre
was very strong and could be widely used in the textile industry in future
application.

3.6. ICP-OES analysis
To detect the amount of silver ions migrated from the bacteriostatic
fibres, ICP-OES was adopted to detect the bacteriostatic fibres after
washing, and the results were compared with the upper limit of heavy
metals in textiles of the ecological textile Oeko-Tex Standard 100 to
identify the bacteriostatic effect of the fibres. The results are listed in
Table 2.
Considering that when bacteriostatic cotton fibres are used in tex­
tiles, water washing is required, and silver ions in the bacteriostatic fi­
bres will dissolve (in part). If the content of silver ions migrating to the
skin exceeds the upper limit for heavy metals in textiles, it will cause
severe skin injury. As shown in Table 2, the Ag content of the prepared
bacteriostatic fibres was 465.544 mg/kg, and the Ag content of the
bacteriostatic fibres after washing was 462.208 mg/kg. The free silver
ion content was 3.336 mg/kg, its content was far smaller than the upper
limit for heavy metals in textiles 50 mg/kg (Oeko-Tex standard 100 for
ecological textiles) (Matousek & Sturgeon, 2003), so the bacteriostatic
fibre met the requirements for the safe use of a textile.

To validate the firmness of the bacteriostatic agent binding in the
bacteriostatic fibres, UV–vis was employed to detect the effect of the
bacteriostatic fibre on the OD of the bacterial solution before and after
washing, and the OD600 nm value was substituted into the formula to
obtain the rate of bacteriostatic activity before and after washing
(Moongraksathum & Chen, 2017). The results are listed in Table 3.
It can be seen from Table 3 that the cotton fibres treated with C-COSAg with a minimum bacteriostatic concentration of 10 μg/mL before
water washing had a bacteriostatic rate of more than 95 % against four
different bacteria. The bacteriostatic rate of S. aureus reached 99.65 %,
and the bacteriostatic effect thereof was obvious. After 50 waterwashing cycles, the bacteriostatic effect against the four kinds of
bacteriostatic fibres was found to be decreased, but the decrease was not
large, and the overall bacteriostatic rate had remained stable above 95
%, indicating that bacteriostatic fibres had a relatively good bacterio­
static performance; when the cotton fibre was treated with C-COS-Ag at
a concentration of 30 μg/mL, the bacteriostatic rate against all four
bacteria before washing was above 99.9 %, and the bacteriostatic effect
after 50 washing cycles exhibited a slight downward trend, but the
overall bacteriostatic rate remained above 99.8 %, indicating that the
self-made bacteriostatic fibre had excellent washing performance and its
good washability was suitable for future applications in the textile
industry.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been widely used as a basic material in fabrics for a wide range of applications owing to its excellent physicochemical and mechanical properties such as excellent mechanical
strength, easy treatment, quick drying and dimensional stability. However, conventional PET-based fabrics always suﬀer from several issues mainly related to bad surface wettability and poor antimicrobial activity.
Therefore, developing simple techniques for imparting multifunctional properties is of a great interest for diverse
practical applications. Herein, we present a facile, scalable and cost-eﬀective route to prepare multifunctional
polyester fabric coated by graphene/silver nanoparticles (PET-G/Ag°) using a simple dip coating method.
Through this approach, the graphene nanosheets coated onto polyester fabric are proposed as excellent support
for Ag° deposition. Due to its high speciﬁc surface area, graphene nanosheets can act as bifunctional agent such
as linker and stabilizer to increase the distribution and stability of silver nanoparticles. The surface morphology
and structure of the coated polyester fabric (PET-G/Ag°) were investigated using optical microscopy, color coordinates, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Surface areas were calculated from the
quantity of nitrogen adsorbed at - 195.8 °C. In comparison with pristine polyester fabric, the coated polyester
fabrics exhibited improved hydrophobic behavior with water contact angle of 122, 126 and 124° for PET-GO,
PET-G and PET-G/Ag°, respectively. In addition, the PET-G/Ag° fabric demonstrates excellent antibacterial
properties against both Staphylococcus aureus as Gram positive and Escherichia coli as negative bacteria due to the

synergistic eﬀect of graphene nanosheets and silver nanoparticles. Furthermore, the coating process is associated
with an enhancement in the thermal stability without signiﬁcant deterioration of the mechanical properties of
the PET-G/Ag° fabric. The proposed approach was considered as a promising and suitable alternative for applying in various industries such as medical, textiles and water treatments.

1. Introduction

the basal carbon plans and carboxyl groups on the edges [23]. These
functional groups confer to GO high dispersibility and compatibility in
water and some organic solvents, which makes it an ideal candidate for
the surface modiﬁcation of textiles surface. Furthermore, chemical reduction of graphene oxide constitutes one of the most used approache
to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with a low cost for mass
production [24]. In addition, reduced graphene oxide nanosheet exhibits many defects and some residual functional groups on its surface,
which serves as active sites for the incorporation of other inorganic
nanomaterials through functionalization or surface modiﬁcation. Besides the aforementioned properties, it has also been reported that
graphene nanosheets possess intriguing hydrophobic properties, and
thus brings new opportunities for textile fabrics with new features such
as anti-fouling, superhydrophobicity/superolephobicity, self-cleaning
and ﬂame retardant properties [25–28]. In fact, Hoai et al. obtained a
superoleophobic/superhydrophobic cotton fabric through thermal reduction of graphene oxide coated on cotton fabric, and applied it as
absorbent for the removal of organic compounds such as oil and organic
solvents [29]. Cai et al. reported the fabrication of durable, conductive,
UV protecting and hydrophobic graphene coated cotton fabric via
thermal reduction [30]. Similarly, Cao et al. have also obtained multifunctional surface modiﬁcation of silk fabric via repeatedly coating
and chemically reducing of graphene oxide [31]. Makowski et al. have
applied multiwall carbon nanotubes/ methyltrichlorosilane (MWCNT/
MTCS) coating to endow polyester fabrics electrical and hydrophobic
properties [32]. The depicted work by Ji et al. demonstrates the successful deposition of GO hydrosol into silk fabric in order to improve
ﬁre resistance and electrical conductivity properties of the said fabric
[17].
On the other hand, transition metals based organic-inorganic materials are highly interesting for a broad range of application [33–35].
Among them, silver nanoparticles are widely investigated for their
optical, electrical, catalytic and biological properties [33,36–38]. It has
been reported that application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) confer
many multifunctional properties to textile fabrics, such as ultraviolet
protection, electrical conductivity, photocatalytic and antibacterial
activity [39–42]. However, the low stability and aggregation tendency
of silver nanoparticles on textile fabrics lead to the reduction of their
eﬃciency [43,44]. In order to avoid these drawbacks, surface modiﬁcation of the textile fabrics with graphene is proved to be an eﬀective
alternative solution for increasing the dispersion, stability and activity
of silver nanoparticles [45–47]. In recent works, several approaches
have been attempted for the use of graphene and silver nanoparticles
coating to develop multifunctional textile fabrics. For example, Moazami et al. have synthesized Ag/rGO composites on raw, aminolyzed
and hydrolyzed polyester fabrics using exhaustion method followed by
curing at 200 °C [48]. Similarly, Xu et al. have reported a simple approach to fabricate GO-encapsulated Ag nanoparticles coated silk ﬁbers
[49]. In their work, Xu et al. stated that GO nanosheets serve as protective layers to avoid AgNPs from detachment and corrosion [49].
Moreover, Babaahmadi et al. have deposited rGO-Ag on PET fabric
through simultaneous coating of GO and Ag+ followed by thermal
annealing at 200 °C, and they found that developed fabrics provide
durable electrical conductivity and ﬂexibility [50]. Wang et al. reported
the synthesis of Ag/rGO coated onto polyester fabric via chemical reduction under microwave irradiation for interference shielding properties [51]. Recently, numerous studies have been conducted to load
AgNPs onto composite nanoﬁber materials such as PVA/PAA to synthesize various types PET of nanocomposites and to enhance the

Over the past decades, ﬂexible and lightweight materials such as
ﬁlms, papers and fabrics have aroused great attentions, and have presented themselves as potential alternatives to rigid substrates in many
applications [1–3]. Among these structures, textile fabrics, including
synthetic (e.g. polyester, polyamide, etc.) and natural materials (e.g.
cotton, silk, wool, etc.) have been considered as promising substrates
for numerous applications, since they are biodegradable, inexpensive
and versatile materials. However, their surface hydrophilicity and
porous structure provide ideal media for the growth of microorganisms,
which limited their applications. Recently, many research attempts
have been devoted to the development of hydrophobic and antibacterial textile fabrics. Accordingly, surface functionalization of textile
fabrics has attracted more interest in both academic and industrial
ﬁelds, and has opened a wide range of new opportunities for textile
fabrics in diverse applications [4,5]. Especially, hydrophobicity in
textiles is highly desired owing to its signiﬁcant role in water repellency, water disinfection and self-cleaning properties [5,6]. In general, the hydrophobicity of a fabric is achieved by creating micro-/
nano- sized structures (i.e. roughness), like lotus leaves, on its surface
through the use of artiﬁcial hydrophobic additives such as polymers,
binders and water repellent agents [7]. A literature survey revealed that
several physical and chemical approaches have been proposed for
fabricating hydrophobic textiles including, electrochemical deposition
[8], plasma [9], chemical vapor deposition [10], electrospinning [11],
hydrothermal [12] and sol gel [7]. However, although these methods
show many advantages, they have some limitations, for example,
complex processes, time loss, and deterioration of mechanical properties of textile products. Furthermore, some of the above-mentioned
methods often require complex equipments and chemical agents which
are both toxic and environmentally polluting [10]. For example, the
CVD requires a sealed space and high reaction temperatures, while
electrospinning requires complex equipment. As a result, it is crucial to
propose promising alternatives to these methods to prepare textile
fabrics through simple and time-saving method. In this context, the
coating methods have emerged as simple and promising approaches for
the fabrication of multifunctional textile fabrics. Such route, expressed
facile, simple and eﬀective, is widely described in the literature in view
of its outstanding advantages such as high homogeneity, good aﬃnity,
low-cost and ease of implementation [13,14]. Several hydrophobic
functional molecule, such as ﬂuoropolymers, alkyl molecules, silicon/
silane molecules and binders, have been used as coatings in order to
achieve hydrophobic textiles [13,15]. Nevertheless, regarding the costeﬀective and environmental factors, these molecules are both expensive
and cause severe environmental hazards. Furthermore, the use of these
molecules would cause a signiﬁcant decrease in the mechanical properties of the resulting textile fabrics. Hence, the main interest is addressed to develop functional textile fabrics using simple, eﬀective and
time-saving methods, while maintaining their ﬂexibility and lightness.
Recently, the surface modiﬁcation of textile fabrics using graphene or
its derivatives has prompted a great scientiﬁc importance particularly
in giving multifunctional properties to textile fabrics [16–19]. Graphene, a single atomic layer of hexagonal sp2 hybridized carbon has
provided diverse applications owing to its multiple advantages, combining ﬂexibility, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, lightness and large surface area [20–22]. In particular, graphene oxide (GO),
the oxidized form of graphene displays an intercalated structure due to
the presence of abundant hydroxyl and epoxy groups on both sides of

dimension of 10 × 4 cm2 was ﬁrstly pretreated with an aqueous solution of ammonia (3 g/L) and nonionic detergent (2 g/L) for 1 h at the
temperature of 100 °C, washed with distilled water and ﬁnally dried in
an oven for 4 h at 80 °C. After that, the previously pretreated polyester
fabric was immersed into an aqueous dispersion of GO obtained by the
dispersion of 50 mg of graphite oxide in 50 mL of deionsied water
(1 mg/mL) for 1 h at room temperature and then dried in an oven for
1 h at 80 °C to yield polyester fabric coated with GO nanosheets (PETGO). The above-mentioned process was repeated for several times to
increase the amount of GO loaded onto the polyester fabric. To prepare
polyester fabric coated with graphene (PET-G), the as-prepared PET-GO
fabric was immersed in a reduction bath containing an aqueous solution
of Na2S2O4 at 50.103 M for 1 h at 95 °C. After the chemical reduction,
the obtained PET-G was washed by distilled water and dried for 1 h at
80 °C. In the second step, PET-G fabric was dipped in an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.05 mol/L) and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, the
wet polyester fabric was introduced into an aqueous solution of N2H4 at
room temperature for 10 min to prepare polyester fabric coated with G/
Ag° nanocomposite (PET-G/Ag°). Finally, the resulting PET-G/Ag°
fabric was washed with distilled water and dried at 80 °C.

catalytic activity of the produced material [52,53]. These versatile
studies show that the resulting performances of the developed fabrics
were mainly controlled by the synergistic eﬀect between graphene and
silver nanoparticles.
In our previous study, we have successfully prepared knit polyester
fabrics coated with graphene oxide, graphene and graphene/silver nanoparticles using a simple and cost-eﬀective dip-coating method to
produce multifunctional knit polyester fabrics [41]. The treated fabrics
displayed outstanding multifunctional performances such as excellent
mechanical properties, excellent electrical conductivity and ultraviolet
protection. As part of our research program aiming at the development
of multifunctional modiﬁed textile fabrics, the present study has been
conducted to study more on multifunctional properties that can the G/
Ag° nanocomposite confer to the polyester fabric. More precisely, the
present work aims to confer multifunctionalities, viz. antibacterial and
hydrophobic properties, on polyester fabrics using a versatile approach.
In the present study, multifunctional polyester fabric was successfully fabricated with a facile dip coating technique and in situ metal
deposition and chemical reduction. Such route expressed facile, simple,
low-cost and eﬀective for textile functionalization. Surface modiﬁcation
was achieved by coating knit polyester fabric with graphene/silver
nanocomposite, in which graphene nanosheets serve as support to
disperse and stabilize silver nanoparticles against oxidation. The surface morphology, chemical structure, wettability, thermal stability,
antibacterial activity and mechanical properties of the treated fabrics
were investigated.

2.3. Characterizations and measurements
The surface morphology of diﬀerent polyester fabrics was observed
on a FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman
spectroscopy of the fabrics was measured using a Thermo-Fisher
Scientiﬁc, DXR2 Raman microscope equipped with an argon-ion laser
beam at a number of 532 nm. The color coordinates and color strength
(K/S) values of the coated fabrics were measured using a spectrophotometer CIE L* a* b* operating at D65/10° observer. A higher K/S
value means stronger color and improved coating. The water contact
angles measurements of the polyester fabrics were determined using an
OCA 40 Micro under ambient conditions using the sessile drop technique. A drop of water was applied on the surface of the untreated and
treated PET fabrics and the contact angle was determined from the
video camera images of the drop after 0 and 12 s. The speciﬁc surface
areas were determined from the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (at −196 °C), using the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method.
The thermal stability of the uncoated and coated polyester fabrics was
investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) using TGA-Q500
(TA instruments) at the heating rate of 10 °C/min in air atmosphere
from 25 to 1000 °C. The antibacterial activity of all polyester fabrics
was evaluated using agar diﬀusion method. In this test, Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were selected as
the testing strains. Each sample was cut into a disc shape of 6 mm of
diameter. Bacteria suspensions were kindly deposited onto the Mueller
Hinton Agar plates in the Petri dishes, and then the uncoated and
coated polyester fabrics were placed. Next, the Petri dishes were incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C, and the inhibition diameters was observed

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and apparatus
Knit polyester fabric (100 g/m2) was designed for coating. Graphite
powder (99.99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfuric acid
(H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (30%wt), Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium
hydrosulﬁte (Na2S2O4), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) and silver nitrate
(AgNO3) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents used in
the present work are of analytical grade and were used without further
puriﬁcation. Deionized water was used throughout the experimental
work.
2.2. Preparation of graphene/Ag nanoparticles coated polyester fabrics
(PET-G/Ag°)
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by simple oxidation and exfoliation processes according to the procedure described in our previous
work [41]. Polyester fabric coated with G/Ag° was also detailed in our
previous work [41]. The process occurs in three consecutive steps as
depicted in Scheme 1. Brieﬂy, a sample of knit polyester fabric with

and measured. Mechanical properties namely the tensile strengths (N)
and elongations at break (%) of the uncoated and coated polyester
fabrics were determined using H50KS Hounsﬁeld.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the modiﬁed polyester fabrics
Fig. 1 showed the digital and microscopic images of PET, PET-GO,
PET-G and PET-G/Ag°. According to this ﬁgure, it is obvious that the
color of polyester fabric was signiﬁcantly aﬀected after coating. It
turned from white to dark brown after several dipping cycles in exfoliated graphene oxide solution and changed to black after chemical
reduction with Na2S2O4, indicating that the surface modiﬁcation of
polyester fabrics was successfully occurred. Also, the deposition of
silver nanoparticles was identiﬁed by a glossy black color observed on
polyester fabric after the reduction with N2H4.
The coating eﬃciency was evaluated by monitoring the change in
color coordinates according to CIE L* a* b* system. The color coordinates values namely L* (lightness), a* (redness-greenness), b*
(yellowness-blueness) color and K/S of all polyester fabrics are summarized in Table 1. Data in Table 1 show a signiﬁcant color diﬀerence
in terms of L*, a*, b* and K/S. The L* value of all coated polyester
fabrics decreased signiﬁcantly from 93.30 for the uncoated PET to
28.10, 28.20 and 30.00 for PET-GO, PET-G and PET-G/Ag°, respectively. This means that the treatment with GO, G and G/Ag° lead to
lower lightness for the coated polyester fabrics. The coated polyester
fabrics also exhibit higher a* (0.30; 0.35 and 0.20 for PET-GO, PET-G
and PET-G/Ag°, respectively) values than the uncoated fabric (−0.64),
while the uncoated polyester shows higher b* value (2.85). This indicates that the color of all coated polyester fabrics tends to more green
color compared to the uncoated one. Moreover, the color strength (K/S)
value at λ410 of all coated polyester fabrics is higher than the uncoated
PET due to the successful deposition of GO, G and G/Ag° on the
polyester fabrics [55].
The surface morphology of knit polyester fabric before and after
coating with GO, G and G/Ag° was investigated at diﬀerent magniﬁcations using Scaning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2). It is clearly
observed that the uncoated polyester fabric exhibits a porous structure
consisting of a long and entangled microﬁbers with very clean and
smooth surface as shown in Fig. 2a–c. However, after several dipping
cycles in exfoliated graphene oxide solution, the polyester ﬁbers surface
was fully wrapped with graphene oxide nanosheets (Fig. 2d–f). These
latter were closely covered on each ﬁber which generates a rough
surface and micro-/nano structures on the ﬁbers surface. Interestingly,

the morphology of PET-G ﬁbers is almost similar to that of PET-GO,
indicating that graphene nanosheets provide also micro-/nano structures and roughness on polyester ﬁbers, as shown in Fig. 2g–i. Furthermore, SEM images of PET-GO and PET-G fabrics revealed that the
ﬁbers were intact after treatment indicating that the fabrics did not
undergo structural changes during their treatments. Compared to PETGO and PET-G, the low magniﬁcation SEM images of PET-G/Ag° show
that the ﬁbers roughness is still maintained due to the presence of
graphene nanosheets, but no other species could be seen on the surface
of graphene (Fig. 2j–l). However, the high magniﬁed image in Fig. 2m
reveals that the surface of PET-G/Ag° ﬁbers contain wrinkles and folds
in which silver nanoparticles were homegeneously deposited and uniformly distributed, as indicated by the arrows. The results obtained
indicated that the as formed AgNPs are successfully deposited into the
surface of the PET/G fabric. It is important to note that graphene nanosheets not only create roughness on the surface of polyester fabric but
also promote the attachment and stabilization of silver nanoparticles
and protect them from oxidation. From all these results, it can be
concluded that GO, G and G/Ag° were successfully deposited on
polyester fabrics through a simple dip coating process to produce PETGO, PET-G and PET-G/Ag° multifonctionnal fabrics. In the other hand,
to determine the change in the BET surface area of the PET fabric after
coating with G-Ag we have analyzed our sample by N2 adsorptiondesorption. From the results of this study, BET surface area was found
to be 176 and 207 m2/g for PET and PET-G/Ag, respectively. The increase observed of BET surface area can be explained by the decrease in
the pore diameter from 41,83 to 41.14 A after coated PET by G/Ag°.
3.2. Raman spectra of the modiﬁed polyester fabrics
Raman spectra was used to characterize the structure of polyester
fabric and also to corroborate the incoporation of GO onto the polyester
fabric surface. The Raman spectra of pristine polyester fabric and GOcoated polyester fabric are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum of the pristine
polyester fabric exhibits three peaks at 1282, 1607 and 1720 cm−1,

contact angle (WCA) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen
that the uncoated PET fabric exhibits a WCA of 0° for the smooth texture and capillary eﬀect of polyester ﬁbers [58]. By comparison, the
contact angle measurements showed that all coated polyester fabrics
have signiﬁcant improvement in hydrophobicity than the uncoated
PET, resulting in repelling water droplet on the fabric surface. Interestingly, it can be seen that PET-GO shows excellent hydrophobic behavior and the corresponding WCA value was 122.7°. The enhanced
hydrophobicity of PET-GO is mainly attributed to the following two
reasons. Firstly, the strong interactions and good compatibility between
GO and the polyester substrate after multiple dipping and drying cycles.
Secondly, the removal of some hydroxyl groups on the surface of graphene oxide nanosheets by drying at 80° for 1 h after each dipping
cycle, which was proved by previous studies [59]. Similarly, chemical
reduction of GO coated polyester fabric resulted in hydrophobic behavior and the WCA was found to be 126.6°, indicating that the majority
of oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene nanosheets
were removed after chemical reduction [17]. More interestingly, the
incorporation of silver nanoparticles onto PET-G had a marginal eﬀect
on the hydrophobicity of the fabric, and the measured WCA value
(124°) was almost similar to that of PET-G fabric. Table 2 shows the
WCA values taken at 0 and 12 s after the droplet was set on the surface
of the surface of fabrics. It can be seen that the contact angle values of
all coated polyester fabrics still unchanged even after 12 s, indicating
that GO, G and G/Ag° coatings were durable on the fabrics surface. All
in all, the treated polyester fabrics showed excellent hydrophobicity
which can potentially be applied for self-cleaning, oil/water separation
and healthcare applications.

which correspond to CeO stretching, C]C stretching and C]O
stretching modes, respectively [56]. After coating with graphene oxide,
the corresponding spectrum of PET-GO shows only two prominent vibration peaks at 1330 cm−1 and 1603 cm−1, which correspond to the D
and G bands of the GO nanosheets, respectively [17,57]. The D band is
characteristic to the structrual defects and disorder in the planar carbon
network, while the G band is related to the stretching vibrations of sp2
hybridized CeC bonds within the graphene sheet. The ratio of intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG) in the case of the GO-coated
polyester fabric is calculated to evaluate the desorder density. The ratio
ID/IG reveals a value of 0.82 which corroborates that GO nanosheets
structures possess a considerable amount of defects due to the oxidation
step [17]. From the Raman and SEM analysis, it was clear that the
coating of GO nanosheets on the polyester fabric surface was successfully occurred over a simple and cost-eﬀective process.

3.4. Thermal properties
Thermal stability is an important property for textile materials because it detemines their performances in practical applications. The
thermo-oxidative stability of coated and uncoated polyester fabrics is
characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air atmosphere
from 25 to 1000 °C. The TGA and DTG thermograms of the uncoated
PET fabric, PET-GO, PET-G and PET-G/Ag° are shown in Fig. 5(a and b),
while the relevant data from these curves such as T5% (5% weight-loss
temperature), T80% (80% weight-loss temperature) and residue (weight
percentage at 600 °C) are listed in Table 3. Based on the DTG curves, the

3.3. Hydrophobic properties
The wettability and water-repellent properties are one of the most
important features of multifuncional fabrics. For this, the wettability of
the polyester fabrics before and after coating was evaluated using water

stability of the polyester fabric [16,61]. Furthermore, the ﬁnal residues
at 600 °C of PET-GO and PET-G are comparable to that of PET, while
more residues are left for PET-G/Ag°. This proves the successful
synthesis of Ag° nanoparticles on the PET-G fabric. The calculated
amount of silver nanoparticles in the coated polyester fabric (PET-G/
Ag°) is about 4.5 wt %.

3.5. Antibacterial activity

uncoated polyester fabric shows two main degradation steps. The ﬁrst
weight loss obtained between 350 °C to 450 °C is attributed to the simultaneous β CH-transfer reaction and depolymerisation [60]. At
higher temperature (450 °C–550 °C), the oxidation of the char formed
during the ﬁrst weight loss step occurs. As compared to the uncoated
PET fabric, the thermal degradation of all the coated fabrics shows the
similar two steps tendency, but with a signiﬁcant improvement in
thermal stability at higher temperature (2nd step) (Table 3). In fact, it
can be observed that coating GO, G and G/Ag° onto polyester fabrics
improves their thermal stability (T80%) by at least 11, 36.5 and 27.4 °C,
respectively. This improvement in thermal stability could be explained
by the homogeneous distribution of the functional nanomaterials and
their strong interfacial interactions with the polyester fabrics [54]. The
formation of graphene on the polyester surfaces acts as a physical
barrier, which delays the polymer chain motions and improves thermal

The antibacterial activity of the untreated and the treated polyester
fabrics was evaluated by the formation of an inhibition zone by a direct
contact method with Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on agar medium (Fig. 6). The uncoated PET, PET-GO and PET-G fabrics showed any antibacterial activity toward Gram positive and negative bacteria, which is in
agreement with previous studies [62,63]. As expected, Ag° nanoparticles loaded on PET-G fabric (PET-G/Ag°) showed excellent inhibition zone (10 mm) against both Gram positive and negative bacteria. The obtained results are in agreement with a recent study on
cotton-polyester blend textile fabrics coated with exfoliated graphenesilver nanoparticles, which reported higher antibacterial eﬃciency
against staphylococcus aureus bacteria [64]. It is well known that silver
nanoparticles exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against wide range
of microorganisms. In fact, the positively charged silver ions can inactivate bacteria by attracting the negatively charged cell membrane
6

adhesion and proliferation of bacteria from reaching the polyester
fabric. Moreover, the presence of graphene nanosheets onto polyester
ﬁbers is highly beneﬁcial to the nucleation and formation of silver
nanoparticles because they can act as active surface to increase their
distribution as well as their stability. This limited the nanoparticles
aggregation and facilitated the sustained Ag+ release and strong
binding to the bacteria cells. These results conﬁrmed that the G/Ag°
nanocomposite provides strong antibacterial activity to the polyester
fabric [65].
3.6. Mechanical properties
Mechanical properties are also important features for the practical
application of the coated polyester fabrics. Fig. 7(a and b) present the
tensile strength (N) and elongation at break (%) of PET, PET-GO, PET-G
and PET-G/Ag° fabrics, which are obtained from the tensile strength elongation curves. In comparison with the uncoated PET fabric, the
tensile strength and the elongation at break of the coated polyester
fabrics are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the functional nanomaterials
application, and over 95% of the original tensile strength could be
maintained. In fact, the tensile strength of the coated polyester fabrics
decreased by 5%, 4% and 2.3% after coating with GO, G and G/Ag°,
respectively. The slight reduction in tensile strength is due to the drying
step of fabrics after each dipping process, which was also reported in
previous works [66,67]. On the other hand, the elongation at break
obtained for all the coated polyester fabrics is marginally improved as
compared to the uncoated one. It was observed that the elongation at
break of PET-GO, PET-G and PET-G/Ag° increased by about 3%, 4% and
5.15%, respectively. This improvement could be attributed to the
ﬂexibility of the functional nanomaterials and to the strong interaction
between functional groups in the polyester fabric and the functional
nanomaterials. Moreover, the synthesis and deposition of silver nanoparticles create G/Ag° cross linking eﬀect between the groups present in
the polyester fabric, which renders the fabric more stretchable than
those coated with GO and G [68]. Therefore, the obtained results reﬂect
the contribution of the functional nanomaterials coated (GO, G and G/
Ag°) on the improvement of mechanical properties of polyester fabrics.

4. Conclusion
We demonstrated here a facile and scalable approach for the successful preparation of G/Ag°-coated polyester fabric using “dip-coating”
method. Morphological investigations show uniform distribution of
silver nanoparticles on graphene–coated polyester fabric. It was concluded that the presence of graphene nanosheets has a positive eﬀect on
the distribution of silver nanoparticles on the polyester fabric. The
coated graphene nanosheets provided also stable coating of Ag° on the
surface of PET-G. The treated polyester fabrics exhibited excellent and
durable hydrophobic properties with WCA of 120.5°, 125.4° and 123°
for PET-GO, PET-G and PET-G/Ag°, respectively. In addition, the
synthesis and deposition of silver nanoparticles onto graphene-coated
polyester fabric demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against

surface trough electrostatic interactions. Thus, the Ag+ ions penetrate
inside the cell membrane, disrupt the membrane structure and destroy
the membrane cell. However, in the case of PET-G/Ag°, the high antibacterial eﬀect is assigned to the synergistic eﬀect of silver nanoparticles and the graphene nanosheets. The graphene nanosheets on the
polyester fabrics possessed high speciﬁc surface area and hydrophobic
character, leading to enhanced barrier properties to reduce the

both Staphylococcus aureus as Gram positive and Escherichia coli as negative bacteria due to the synergistic eﬀect of graphene nanosheets and
silver nanoparticles. Moreover, the prepared polyester fabrics showed
also enhanced thermal stability and mechanical properties compared to
the uncoated one. The proposed strategy is believed to have great potential application in developing multifunctional textile fabrics in many
areas.

Abstract. In the present study, antibacterial cotton fabrics loaded with silver nanoparticle were
prepared. The fabrics were first treated by plasma and alkaline solution to improve their
reactivity. Then silver oxide nanoparticles were loaded on the fabrics by ultrasonic spray
treatment. Finally, the fabrics loaded with silver nanoparticles were obtained by reduced the
silver oxide in-situ via H2 DBD cold plasma. The samples were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.
The results indicate that nanoparticles loaded on the final samples are fine, uniform and exist in
the form of metallic state. The antibacterial performance of the samples was evaluated and the
results indicated that the samples had antibacterial activity against both Escherichia coli and
Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, the antibacterial fabrics prepared by this method have a
potential application prospect in the medical fields.
Keywords. Silver nanoparticle; plasma technology; antibacterial fabrics.

1. Introduction
Compared with antibiotics, silver-based antibacterial agents have the advantages of broad spectrum,
long-lasting sterilization and high efficiency, which makes them have potential application value in the
medical fields. The antibacterial mechanism of silver-based antibacterial agents is complex and
multiple, especially the silver nanoparticles, which can destroy cell membrane, affect cell penetration
and penetrate into the bacterial cells to bind with protein, achieving antibacterial effect.
Silver nanoparticles with high specific surface area can release Ag+ continuously and maintain the
concentration for a long time [1]. However, the preparation of silver nanoparticles often requires
harmful adhesives, reducing agents, and harmful dispersants. There is a large market demand for
antibacterial fabrics in the field of human daily life and medical care. At present, the methods of
preparing antibacterial fabrics loaded with silver nanoparticles mainly include chemical reduction [2],
in-situ biosynthesis [3] and photodegradation deposition [4], etc. However, the industrial production of
antibacterial fabrics is restricted by the harmful chemical agents, harsh reaction conditions and
complex process involved in these methods mentioned above.
Plasma technology has been widely used in the field of surface modification. For example,
atmospheric cold plasma technology is used to improve the hydrophilicity of materials by introducing

the hydrophilic groups such as -OH, C=O, COO-, -OOH, -COOH, -NH2, and -NH on the surface of
the material [5, 6]. At the same time, the H radical or atom generated in hydrogen cold plasma under
dielectric barrier discharge can be used to reduce metal oxides. Plasma surface modification
technology has the advantages of simple operation, environmental protection and high efficiency.
In this study, a method of using plasma technology and ultrasonic spraying technology to prepare
the cotton fabrics loaded with fine and uniform silver nanoparticles was reported. The morphology of
the samples and the chemical state of silver element were studied. The antibacterial activities of the
samples were also evaluated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
In this experiment, commercially available cotton fabrics (area 3 cm × 3 cm) were used. The fabrics
were ultrasonically cleaned by ethanol solution for 30 minutes. Then they were rinsed by distilled
water repeatedly. AgNO3 (AR) and sodium hydroxide (AR) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd.

Figure 1. Schematic for the synthesis of Ag-decorated cotton fabric.
2.2. Preparation
The fabrication process of nanoparticles loaded on fabrics is shown as figure 1. Firstly, the fabrics
were treated by air cold plasma. The ambient cold plasma equipment was homemade as figure 1b. In
this treatment, a high alternating pulse voltage was applied to ceramic electrode and the ceramic plate,
which can make the air ionized. Fabrics put on the ceramic plate were treated by the plasma layer that
caused by air ionization. The insulated handle fixed to the ceramic electrode moved back and forth
over the fabrics at a speed of 1 cm/s. After 3 minutes, the treatment was finished. Then the fabrics
were immersed into 0.15 mol/L NaOH solution for 2 minutes with magnetic stirring, as shown in
figure 1c. Then rinsed the fabrics with running deionized water.
Then the fabrics were placed in a container which connected to an ultrasonic atomizer. The
ultrasonic atomizer was used to create AgNO3 spray. This treatment lasted 5 minutes under dark
conditions, as shown in figure 1d. Then rinsed and dried at room temperature. The concentrations of
AgNO3 solution in this process were variously 11.8 mM, 23.6 mM, 35.3 mM and 88.3 mM, and

samples obtained were represented by CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4, respectively. CE1-2 and CE1-3 were
obtained by repeating the process of soaking CE1 with 0.15 mol/L NaOH solution and spraying 11.8
mM AgNO3 solution twice and three times, respectively. Similarly, CE2-2, CE2-3, CE3-2 and CE3-3
were obtained.
Finally, the DBD system was used in reduction reaction, as shown in figure 1e. Before the
treatment, the mixture of H2 and Ar was imported into the reactor which contained the samples.
Voltage was applied to two parallel metal plates which covered with quartz plates, when the gas
entered the narrow gap (the height of 3 mm), it would be breakdown and discharged due to the high
potential difference, so as to generate the H radicals and atoms, which can reduce metal oxide. The
treatment lasted for 15 s, and the input power was 25W, the gas flow rate was 30 mL/min. The
samples obtained were represented by CA1, CA1-2, CA1-3, CA2, CA2-2, CA2-3, CA3, CA3-2,
CA3-3 and CA4, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were conducted via a Panalytical X'Pert'3 Powder
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056Å) at a scan rate of 10°/min in the range
10°-80°. XPS was used to study changes after loading nanoparticles and prove the existence of Ag
NPs, using a VG ESCALAB MARK II spectrometer with an Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) X-ray source, and
collected spectral data were calibrated by the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (Hitachi SU-70) was used to study the microstructure of the fabrics and the silver
nanoparticles. The morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL-2000EX) at
a 200 kV accelerating voltage.
2.4. Antibacterial Experiments
The antibacterial activity of the samples was evaluated by Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus.The inhibition zone was used to evaluate the antibacterial performance. Firstly, the bacterial
solution was adjusted to 0.5 McDonnell turbidity, and then the bacterial solution was dipped with a
sterile cotton swab and it was applied evenly on the agar medium. The samples were cut into the
prescribed circles (diameter 5 mm). Then they were plated on the agar surface. After that, the medium
was placed at 37°C for 18 hours. Finally, the diameter of the inhibition zone around the sample is
measured to evaluate the antibacterial efficiency. The tests were repeated three times in the same
conditions for each sample, and the average diameter of inhibition zone represents the antibacterial
performance.
3. Results
3.1. Synthesis Mechanism of Silver Nanoparticles
The hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups were introduced after plasma treatment, which improves
wettability of the fabrics. When the fibers were immersed in sodium hydroxide solution, the cellulose
in the fibers swelled and the hydrogen bonds between the cellulose long chains were broken, making
more groups in the chains exposed. Thereby the reactivity of the fibers was greatly improved.
In the ultrasonic spray process, the fabrics contacted to the AgNO3 spray and ion exchange
interaction and complexation would take place. A large number of nucleation sites were provided as
the fibers surface were rough. Meanwhile, the reactions were separated from the solution, the silver
ions were hard to replenish. So the resulting silver oxide grains were fine and uniform, firmly loaded
on the fibers due to the static electricity.
Plasma equipment produced excited H radicals and atoms, which had high reducibility and made
the Ag2O nanoparticles rapidly transform into Ag nanoparticles in-situ. The fabrics loaded with fine
and uniform silver nanoparticles were obtained.

3.2. Characterization of the Fabrics Loaded with Nanoparticles
The XRD results are shown in figure 2. It can be seen that there is no obvious diffraction peak of
silver or silver oxide. This may be due to the low content of silver loaded in the samples.
The XPS was used to study the chemical state of the element on the sample surface. Figure 3
clearly shows the Ag3d peak in the sample CE2 and CA2, compared with the pristine cotton fabrics,
proving the presence of silver element after treatment. To further investigate the state of the silver
element, XPS analyses of Ag 3d and Auger spectra (MNN) of Ag were shown in figures 4 and 5,
respectively. It is hard to distinguish as the Ag 3d orbital binding energies of silver and silver oxide
are close. The sample CA2 exhibits two peaks corresponding to Auger kinetic energy of metallic Ag
[7]. Similarly, sample CE2 correspond to Ag2O [8]. Thus, it can demonstrate the rapid reduction effect
of H2 DBD cold plasma.
Figures 6-8 show the SEM images of the samples. Figure 7 clearly shows that the nanoparticles
loaded on the sample CA1, CA1-2, CA1-3 are fine and uniform, with the diameter between 4 nm and
10 nm, which is attributed to the fibers provides a large number of nucleation sites on the fibers
surface with the improvement of hydrophilicity and reactivity. In addition, this is also related to the
mist droplets in the size of micrometers produced by ultrasonic atomization. With the increase of spray
concentration and spray times, the grains grew and aggregated gradually. As shown in figure 7d, the
size of the larger nanoparticles in sample CA2-2 is about 30 nm. In figures 7f and 8c-8e, the
agglomeration of nanoparticles appeared. Comparing figures 6d and 7b, figures 6f and 8b, it can be
seen from that by increasing the spray times to increase the loading amount is better than by increasing

the spray concentration. In figure 9c, the EDX mapping of sample CA4 indicated that the
nanoparticles loaded on the fibers contain silver element.

TEM was used to investigate the morphology of nanoparticles loaded on fabrics. The particles were
collected from the alcohol solution after ultrasonic processing for 30 minutes. It can be seen from
figures 10a and 10b that the nanoparticles loaded on samples CA1-3 and CE1-3 are fine and uniform,
with the diameter between 4 nm and 10 nm, and there is no obvious aggregation phenomenon, which
is consistent with the SEM observation results. Observe the high-resolution TEM images, as shown in
figures 10c and 10d, the lattice fringes of nanoparticles loaded on sample CA1-3 and sample CE1-3
were 0.236 nm and 0.334 nm, respectively, which can be well indexed to the (111) plane of Ag and
the (110) plane of Ag2O [9, 10]. The results suggested that Ag+ were reduced to Ag0 by H2 DBD,
consisted with the results of XPS.

Figure 11. Antimicrobial activity of pristine cotton fabrics, sample CA1-3, CA2-3 and CA3.
The antimicrobial results were shown in figure 11. The inhibiting effect can be summarized as the
order: CA1-3 > CA3 > CA2-3 > pristine. There is no inhibition zone around the pristine cotton fabrics,
indicating it has no inhibitory effect. The other samples have good antibacterial properties, it can be
attributed to the direct interaction of silver nanoparticles with cells and the release of silver ions.
Comparing CA1-3, CA3 and CA2-3, we can find, although the CA2-3 has the highest content of
silver, its antibacterial performance is the worst. The silver content of CA1-3 and CA3 is almost equal,
while the antibacterial performance of CA1-3 is better. All of them can be attributed to agglomeration
of silver nanoparticles. It shows that the multiple ultrasonic atomization is a promising and efficient
method to prepare antibacterial fabrics loaded with fine and uniform silver nanoparticles.
4. Conclusions
The present research introduced a simple method to prepare cotton fabrics loaded with fine and
uniform silver nanoparticles. Antibacterial experiments show that the samples have good antibacterial
properties. The antibacterial fabric prepared by this method has a great prospect in medical application.

INTRODUCTION
In the past few decades, due to a rapid increase in the number of industries as well as the human population, a large
amount of pollutants have been flooded into the ecosystem, leading to major health risks [1]. Hence, wastewater
treatment has become an important concern and scientists are looking for low–cost and environmentally friendly
solutions to address this problem. Using a semiconductor–based catalyst in photo–, sono– and photosonocatalytic
activity has been proven to be effective in solving the problem of environmental pollution. Thus, over the past few
years, research has been focused on developing effective visible light driven semiconductors.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most promising semiconductors for photocatalysis due to its low cost, high stability,
and environmentally benign nature [2]; however, ZnO has several limitations. Firstly, ZnO can only be activated in
UV light or in the near–ultraviolet region [2]. This limits the large-scale usage of ZnO since solar radiation consists
of 5 % UV, 43 % visible light, and 52 % infrared radiation. The second issue is the high recombination of the generated

Abstract Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/nanographene platelets (NGP) composites with different NGP loadings were synthesized in
the present study using a simple hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activities of the prepared Ag/
Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites were then studied for their ability to degrade different kinds of dyes in aqueous solutions
under visible light irradiation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate a face-centered cubic structure for Ag, a cubical
spinel structure for Fe3O4, a monoclinic structure for CuO, and a hexagonal wurtzite structure for ZnO. Furthermore, a
graphite-like structure could be detected for NGP. The thermal stability of the samples was evaluated by TGA; the results
further confirm the good agreement between the actual and theoretical (5, 10, and 15 wt.%) weight loadings of NGP in the
samples. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorbance spectroscopy was used to analyze the optical properties of the prepared
samples; a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon could be detected around ~ 440 nm and after the addition of
NGP, the absorption band shifted to the visible light region. The ternary Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites exhibit a
significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity than either Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO or Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO in degrading a
methylene blue (MB) dye in an aqueous solution. When the NGP loading was 10 wt.%, the composites displayed the
highest photocatalytic activity. The Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP could efficiently degrade a variety of organic dyes, such as
MB, Congo red (CR), and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. The species active in the degradation process
were found to be the holes. More importantly, Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites demonstrated good stability and
reusability in repetitive photocatalytic activity processes.

electron-hole pairs, which results in low photocatalytic efficiency [3]. Moreover, difficulties exist in the separation of
ZnO from the treated solutions.
To solve the first problem, ZnO could be combined with other semiconductor materials such as CuO, which have
a narrow band gap [4]. It was found that CuO is a good candidate for this purpose due to its narrow band gap energy
of about 1.2 eV [4], which is smaller than that of ZnO. The problem of reusability can be overcome by combining the
ZnO semiconductor with magnetic materials, such as iron oxide (Fe3O4) [5].
Some researchers found that combining a semiconductor with carbonic materials, such as graphene, and noble
metals, such as silver, can enhance its photocatalytic activity. Graphene, a single layer two–dimensional graphitic
structure with a high specific surface area, exhibits high electrical conductivity [3]; it can enable the semiconductor
photocatalyst to trap the electrons before they are recombined with holes. Ag nanoparticles can enhance the localized
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in semiconductor materials and extend light absorption to the visible light region
[6]. Furthermore, the noble metal nanoparticles on the surface of the semiconductor can form a Schottky barrier, which
acts as an electron trapper [7]. Therefore, in this study, Ag nanoparticles prepared using a microwave assisted–
colloidal method was combined with a ZnO semiconductor to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of the
semiconductor.
In this regard, we report a series of magnetically separable Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/nanographene platelets (NGP)
composites as visible light driven photocatalysts. The preparation method has significant advantages such as the
possibility of operating on a large scale, low process temperature, and short preparation time. The samples were further
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze the microstructure, by energy dispersive X–ray (EDX)
spectroscopy to evaluate the elemental composition of the composites, and by Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the
properties of NGP and Ag in the samples. The photocatalytic activities of all the prepared samples were evaluated by
analyzing the degradation of methylene blue (MB), Congo red (CR), and methylene orange (MO) dyes under visible
light irradiation. The influence of scavengers on the reactive species was studied. Finally, the reusability of the ternary
photocatalyst system after four successive cycles was also studied.

Materials. NGP was obtained from Arngstron Materials Inc. Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4•7H2O, 99 %),
copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4•5H2O, 99 %), zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4•7H2O, 99 %), silver nitrate
(AgNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol, ethylene glycol (EG), methylene blue, Congo red, and methylene
orange were purchased from Merck. All chemical reagents (Merck) were of analytical grade and used without further
purification.

Catalyst Preparation
Synthesis of Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO composites. Fe3O4, CuO, and Ag nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple
sol-gel method, according to the procedure reported in the literature [8, 9]. The procedure for the synthesis of the Ag/
Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO composites is as follows. ZnSO4•7H2O and NaOH were mixed together in distilled water and this
suspension was stirred vigorously at 80 °C using a magnetic stirrer. To this suspension, ethanol/water solutions
containing Fe3O4, CuO, and Ag nanoparticles in particular ratios were added. After 2 h of stirring at 80 °C, the mixed
solution was collected, washed, aging, and dried at 125 °C for 1 h under vacuum. In this experiment, the amount of
Ag nanoparticles was fixed at 25 wt.% of the final composite.
Synthesis of Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites. To synthesize the Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites, a
simple hydrothermal method based on the approach proposed by Khalid et al. was used [10]. In brief, NGP (5, 10, and
15 wt.%) was dissolved in a solution of water (80 mL) and ethanol (40 mL) via ultrasonication over a period of 2 h.
Subsequently, the Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO composite was added to this solution and stirred for 2 h to achieve a
homogenous suspension. The suspension was then heated at 120 °C for 3 h to induce the deposition of the Ag/
Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO composites on the NGP sheets. Finally, the resulting composites were dried at 70 °C overnight. The
Fe3O/CuO/ZnO, Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO and Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/10wt.% NGP will be labeled as FCZ, AgFCZ, and
AgFCZ–10wt.% NGP, respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL

Sample Characterization
The obtained samples were characterized using several techniques. To identify the crystalline phases in the
samples, an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Miniflex 600) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) was used. Thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Rigaku Thermo Plus EVO2 TG-8121) was used to decipher the thermal stability of the
prepared samples. For evaluating the NGP optical properties, Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out Raman
spectra were acquired on a Raman microscope (Thermo Scientific DXR xi Raman Imaging Microscope) with a 5 mW
of 532 nm laser as the monochromatic radiation source. Elemental analyses and the morphologies of the samples were
determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (LEO 420).

Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic degradation was investigated in several steps. A methylene blue (MB) solution (20 mg/L) was
used as the model organic pollutant solution. 0.03 g of the as-synthesized sample was added to a 100 mL MB solution
and vigorously stirred for 30 min under dark conditions to ensure an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then the asprepared solution was irradiated with visible light for 2 h. After every 15 min, the absorbance of the MB solution was
measured using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency was then calculated according to the
following equation
% = 1−

100%

where C0 is the initial concentration of MB before irradiation and Ct is the concentration of MB after a certain
irradiation time. The degradation of other dyes (Congo red and methylene orange) was also studied. Finally, the
photostability of the prepared samples during the degradation of MB was evaluated with four repeated experiments
under the same conditions.

Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesized AgFCZ composites; the diffractograms exhibit
several peaks corresponding to a cubical spinel Fe3O4 crystal structure at 2θ of 30.14°, 35.49°, 43.28°, 53.76°, 57.20°,
and 62.83°, to a monoclinic CuO structure at 38.81° and 48.7°, and to a hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure at 34.47°,
36.26°, 47.50°, 56.70°, 68.06°, and 69.21°. The peaks at 38.14°, 44.26°, and 64.42° correspond to the (111), (200),
and (220) planes of the cubic phase of Ag; however, the diffraction peaks of metallic Ag could not be detected,
probably due to its low content [11]. After the addition of NGP (5, 10, and 15 wt.%) to the samples, a new peak at
26.40° corresponding to the (002) plane of the graphitic structure could be detected. The peak intensity of NGP in the
Ag/ Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP composites becomes stronger as the NGP content increases, which may be ascribed to the
highly uniform dispersion of NGP in the composites.
To analyze the elemental composition of the samples, EDX measurements were carried out on the samples FCZ,
AgFCZ, and AgFCZ-10wt.% NGP. Figure 2 depicts the EDX spectra of the samples; it reveals the presence of O, Zn,
Cu, and Fe in all the samples, which confirms the existence of ZnO, CuO, and Fe3O4. Furthermore, the addition of Ag
nanoparticles led to the presence of several new peaks in the range of 3-3.3 keV [12], thus indicating the inclusion of
Ag in the samples. The C signal in the EDX spectrum of the AgFCZ-10 wt.% NGP sample originates from NGP. It
must be noted that there are no unexpected signals in the EDX spectra, which indicates the purity of the samples.
The presence of NGP and Ag nanoparticles in the AgFCZ–10wt.% NGP composites were further confirmed using
Raman analysis. The Raman spectra of the NGP, AgFCZ, and AgFCZ–10wt.% NGP samples are shown in Fig. 3. In
the Raman spectrum of NGP, three typical bands corresponding to D, G, and 2D can be found at ~1333, ~1567, and
2687 cm–1, respectively [2]. The Raman peaks corresponding to NGP could still be detected in the spectrum of Ag/
Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP; furthermore, these three peaks are slightly shifted to lower frequencies when compared with
the peaks in the pristine NGP spectrum, indicating that a portion of NGP is reduced. In Fig. 3, we can also see peaks
located at ~ 484, ~ 688, and ~1045 cm–1, which may due to the SPR of Ag nanoparticles [13].
Figure 4a and Fig. 4b showed the degradation efficiency of the prepared samples when they were used to treat MB
solutions. For comparison, MB solutions were also irradiated by direct visible light under similar conditions without
any samples. The concentration of MB after different treatment times were compared with the initial concentration
(Ct/C0) to evaluate the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst. Figure 4a depicts the changes in the photocatalytic

efficiency of the prepared samples in 90 min. As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, the degradation efficiency of AgFCZ
increased with the addition of 10 wt.% NGP, whereas it decreased upon the addition of 15 wt.% NGP. The addition
of 10 wt.% NGP maximized the degradation efficiency to 100 % in 90 min. This is mainly because NGP slows down
the recombination of the electron-hole pairs [2], surface-adsorbed amount of chemical molecules, and enhances the
absorption rate. However, further addition of NGP may cause a screening effect, in which too much NGP covers the
active sites of the material, prevents light from reaching the material surface, and reduces the generation of electrons
and holes, thereby inhibiting the degradation of MB [2, 10].
It is well known that the photocatalytic degradation reaction follows the pseudo first-order reaction kinetics model.
The degradation rate constant was calculated using the following formula:
=
Additionally, in order to investigate the ability of AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP composites to degrade different dyes, three
dyes (MB, CR, and MO) were chosen as the organic pollutants. In Fig. 5, we can see that the AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP

composites could completely degrade the MB and CR pollutants, while the MO was degraded by 90 %. These results
indicate that AgFCZ–10wt.% NGP shows great potential for the degradation of different dye pollutants in water. To
investigate the role of these reactive species, several scavengers, such as di–ammonium oxalate (hole scavenger),
sodium sulfate (electron scavenger), and t–butyl alcohol (hydroxyl radical scavenger), were used. Figure 6 illustrates
the influence of these scavengers on the degradation of MB when treated with AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP composites. It
can be observed that the addition of scavengers reduced the degradation efficiency of the pristine AgFCZ–10 wt.%
NGP composites. The reduction in the degradation efficiency may be due to the inhibition effect of the scavengers on
the reactive species. The degree of inhibition follows the order holes > hydroxyl radicals > electrons, which indicates
that the generated holes play the most important role in the photodegradation process.
The reusability of a catalyst is an important consideration for practical applications. To test the reusability of the
AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP composites, we investigated the photocatalytic activity of the composite in four repeated cycles
(Fig. 7). The inset in Fig. 7 shows that the AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP composite can be easily recovered using a magnetic
bar. Even after being used for four times, the composites still exhibited excellent performance.

In the present study, NGP and Ag nanoparticles were combined with ZnO to develop Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP
composites as magnetically separable visible light photocatalysts. The prepared samples were characterized using
XRD, EDX, and Raman spectroscopy. From the XRD and EDX results, we concluded that all the samples exhibit
good agreement with theoretical Ag/Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO/NGP. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy showed that NGP and
Ag are successfully incorporated in the Fe3O4/CuO/ZnO systems. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was
enhanced after the addition of NGP due to a reduction in the recombination of the electron-hole pairs. By studying the
effect of scavengers, it was deduced that the holes play an important role in the degradation process. Moreover, the
prepared AgFCZ–10 wt.% NGP composites showed good stability and reusability in treating organic pollutant loaded
aqueous solutions.

ABSTRACT
Pathogens (bacteria, fungus and virus) are becoming a potential threat to the
health of human beings and environment worldwide. They widely exist in the
environment, with characteristics of variety, spreading quickly and easily causing
adverse reactions. In this work, an Ag-based material is used to be incorporated and
functionalized in polycotton fabrics using pad-dry-cure method. This composite proved
to be effective for inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decreasing the number of
replicates in 99.99% after an incubation period of 2 minutes. In addition, it caused
99.99% inhibition of the pathogens S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans, preventing crossinfections and does not cause allergies or photoirritation processes, demonstrating the
safety of its use.

INTRODUCTION
Pathogenic microbes are becoming a potential threat to the health of human
beings and environment worldwide. Today, the humanity has experienced epidemic
diseases caused by both new and well known viruses, including hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS,
SARS-CoV, MERS, Lassa fever, Zika virus, and Ebola virus, as well as Yellow Fever,
Influenza, and Measles virus, which are more widespread but can be severe, despite the
availability of vaccines.[1] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Since its first detection in December 2019,[2] it has affected millions of people
worldwide, carrying a mortality rate much higher than the common flu. These public
health outbreaks driven by emerging COVID-19 infectious diseases constitute the
forefront of global safety concerns and significant burden on global economies. While
there is an urgent need for its effective treatment based on antivirals and vaccines, it is
imperative to explore any other effective intervention strategies that may reduce the
mortality and morbidity rates of this disease.
In the absence of an effective vaccine, it is expected that not only the current
pandemic will continue for several months, but other outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2
may take place in the future, in the coming months or years.[3] Furthermore, unknown
viruses and/or pathogens will likely emerge again, and their pathogenicity, spread,

contagion, and mechanism of action will be inquired. This current global crisis alarms
us to the fact that we urgently need to prepare ourselves for a new and unpredictable
epidemic in the future.
The human body is a diverse ecosystem that harbors hundreds of trillions of
microbes (bacteria, fungi and viruses)[4] that might be or become pathogenic under
certain circumstances. The development of innovative materials capable of avoiding the
transmission, spread, and entry of these pathogens into the human body is currently in
the spotlight. Highly effective agents are needed not only to control the emergence of
new COVID-19 pandemia, their increased proliferation capability, and resistance that
severely impact public health, but it is also fundamentally essential to explore strategies
for the preparation and application of new materials against pathogen infection.
Often, the surface of a material is the medium by which the human body
interacts with microbes. Therefore, anti-pathogen strategies based on chemical
modification of the material surface have been developed. One procedure is to form a
layer on the surface of the material, thereby reducing the chance of contact between the
pathogen and the surface of the material. This greatly reduces the number of pathogens
adhering to the surface. Another strategy is that killing the adhered pathogen directly by
decorating the surface of the material with the biocide agent.
Use of personal protective equipment is considered to be one of the most
important strategies for protecting from transmissible pathogens, particularly when
aerosol transmission occurs and when no effective treatment or prophylaxis is available
for the disease provoked by these pathogens in question. In the case of COVID-19, for
instance, the WHO has recently issued recommendation for widespread use of face
masks as an important tool in the control of SARS-CoV-2 spread.[5] Therefore, the
current worldwide public health crisis of COVID-19 has highlighted the particularly
emergent need for materials that inactivate enveloped viruses on contact for preventing
transmission.
Inorganic biocide surfaces and materials have attracted much attention due to
their better stability and safety as compared with organic reagents for preventing
infections and transmission. Among inorganic agents, silver cation and metal are most
widely used. However, Ag cations tend to react with Cl−, HS−, and SO42− in aqueous
solution, forming precipitates, thus losing their biocide activity, which affects the
practical application of Ag-loaded biocide agents to a certain extent. Ag and its
compounds have been widely used since from ancient time, in 1000 BC, to prevent
bacterial growth and wound infections, and make water potable.[6] Ag metal is a
precious metal and is easily discolored under light and heat, but for many years, it was
used as medical treatment as a broad-spectrum antibacterial compound before the
discovery of antibiotics in the early 20th century.[7,8]
Nanotechnology is capable of modifying both Ag cation and metal into their
nano range, which dramatically changes their chemical and physical properties. Ag
nanoparticles (AgNPs) acquire special attention due to its specificity and environment
friendly approach with a wide application in industry and medicine due to its
antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal and anti-parasitic characters. The use of AgNPs has
been greatly enhanced due to the development of antibiotic resistance against several
pathogenic bacteria, and they are employed in biomedical industry as coatings in
dressings, in medicinal devices, in the form of nanogels in cosmetics and lotions,
etc.[6,9,10]
According to the literature, there are plenty of protocols focused on the
production of hybrid/composite materials based on Ag NPs, whose architecture is
driven by different synthetic methods and reaction mechanisms.[11–17] While the
precise reasons for this unique chemistry and physics are unknown, the observed

structures, their reproducibility, and synthetic control this reaction offers, there is plenty
of room to find innovative possibilities for new technologies.[18,19]
Ag NPs have been proven to be most useful because they have excellent
antimicrobial properties against lethal viruses, microbes/germs, and other
microorganisms. These NPs are certainly the most extensively utilized material among
all. Thus, it has been used as antimicrobial agent in different textile industries.[20] The
noble metal NPs are considered as more specific and multipurpose agents with a
diversity of biomedical applications considering their use in extremely sensitive
investigative assays, radiotherapy enhancement, gene delivery, thermal ablation, and
drug delivery. These metallic NPs are also considered to be nontoxic in case of gene and
drug delivery applications. Thus, metallic NPs can offer diagnostic and therapeutic
possibilities simultaneously.[16].
The purpose of this work is to present an innovative material with high
bactericide, fungicide and virucide efficiency in their incorporation and application in
textile applications such as cotton-based materials that make special biopolymer hosts
for composite materials. Finally, it is important to study the reliability of sintered
AgNPs, to test and analyze its allergic response, dermatological photoirrritant and
photosensitive effects, as well as their antimicrobial, fungicide and antiviral activity
EXPERIMENTAL: MATERIALS AND METHODS
Application of chemical finishing onto fabrics
A fine-medium weight 67% polyester / 33% cotton woven fabric (plain weave,
120 g/m²; width 1,60m; ends 35/cm; picks 26/cm; yarn Ne 36 67%Polyester / 33%
cotton) purchased from local suppliers (São Carlos/SP, Brazil) was used for the
application purpose. An AgNP colloidal solution (AgNP-CS) and an AgNP colloidal
solution stabilized with organic polymers (AgNP-OP) were applied on the polycotton
fabric using pad-dry-cure method (NanoxClean® Ag+Fresh 5K, and NanoxClean®
Ag+Fresh Hybrid, respectively, provided by Nanox Tecnologia S.A. – São Carlos/SP Brazil). An acrylic-based binder compound was used in the impregnation solution as
well (Starcoat Denim 50GL provided by Star Colours LTDA. – Americana/SP, Brazil).
The polycotton fabric cut to the size of 30x30 cm was immersed in the solution
containing 5% (% weight basis) of the antimicrobial products and 6% of the acrylicbased binder (% weight basis), for 5 minutes and passed through a laboratory scale
padder, with a 72% wet pick-up maintained for all the treatments. After drying (80°C, 3
min) the fabric was annealed at 170°C for 3 min, then washed with deionized water and
then dried at 80°C for 3 min in a ventilated oven. All samples were then conditioned at
25°C and 65% relative humidity for 48h. Samples were produced according to Table 1.

argon-ion laser (Melles Griot, United States) operating at λ = 514.5 nm and 200 mW.
The spectra were carried out bin the range of 100-3500 cm-1. Morphologies of the
composites were analyzed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM)
on a FEI instrument (Model Inspect F50) operating at 1 kV. Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using a Jasco FT/IR-6200 (Japan)
spectrophotometer operated in absorbance mode at room temperature. The spectra were
carried out in the range of 400-4000 cm-1.
Assessment of Antimicrobial Activity
The AATCC 147 Parallel Streak Standard Method[21] was used as a qualitative
method to evaluate antibacterial activity of the treated fabrics. Sterile plate count agar
was dispensed in petri plates. 24 hours broth cultures of the test organisms (Escherichia
Coli (E. coli - ATCC8739) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus - ATCC6538) were
used as inoculums. Using a 10µL inoculation loop, 1 loop full of culture was loaded and
transferred to the surface of the agar plate by making 7.5cm long parallel streaks 1 cm
apart in the center of the plate, refilling the loop at every streak. The test specimen was
gently pressed transversely, across the five inoculums of streaks to ensure intimate
contact with the agar surface. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 18-48 hours. After
incubation, a streak of interrupted growth underneath and along the side of the test
material indicates antibacterial effectiveness of the fabric.
The quantitative antimicrobial activity assessment of the treated polycotton
fabrics was determined according to AATCC Test Method 100[22]. Fabric specimens
(circular swatch 4.8 cm in diameter) were impregnated with 1.0 mL of inoculum in a
250 mL container. The inoculum was a nutrient broth culture containing 2.0~3.0 ·
105/mL colony forming units of microorganisms. E. coli and S. aureus were used as a
reference for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively, and C. albicans
(ATCC 10231) as a reference for fungus. The microorganisms counted on the treated
polycotton fabric and those on a controlled sample were determined after a 24-hour
incubation period at 37°C. The antimicrobial activity was expressed in terms of
percentage reduction of the microorganism after contact with the test specimen
compared to the number of microbial cells surviving after contact with the control. The
results are expressed as percent reduction of microorganisms by Eq. (1).
Reduction (%) = [(B-A)/B] x 100

where A and B are the numbers of bacteria or fungus recovered from the
antimicrobial-treated and untreated polycotton fabrics in the jar incubated over the
desired contact period, respectively.
Assessment of Antiviral Activity
An adaptation of ISO 18184 Determination of antiviral activity of textile
products Standard Method[23] was used as a reference for a quantitative method to
evaluate the treated polycotton’s ability to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles
(SARS-CoV-2/human/BRA/SP02cc/2020 - MT350282), under the tested conditions, at
two different time intervals (2 and 5 minutes of contact time). The virus was inoculated
into liquid media containing no fabric, treated and non-treated polycotton samples and
incubated for 2 different time periods. Then, they were plated onto tissue cultures of
Vero CCL-81 cells. After the incubation, the viral genetic material was quantified in
each condition using real-time quantitative PCR, and based on the control samples, the
ability of each sample to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 was determined.
Briefly, Vero CCL-81 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per
well. The cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose culture medium (Sigma-

Aldrich, 51435C) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin,
and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin. The plate was incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 atmosphere
for 24 h. Following this period, the medium was removed and replaced with 666.7 µL
of DMEM High Glucose/well without supplementation.
Three test specimens, non-treated polycotton control and Ag-based antimicrobial
treated polycotton samples, measuring 6.25 cm2 apiece, were tested. Each test specimen
was placed into a different tube and 1.33 mL of DMEM high glucose medium without
supplementation was added to each tube. In parallel, 500 µL of culture medium
containing SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in 4.5 mL of DMEM medium without
supplementation, and then 333.4 µL of this viral suspension was added to each of the
tubes containing the pieces of cloth. The mixtures were incubated with the virus for 2
min and the tubes were homogenized every 30 seconds. After this period, 166.7 µL of
each sample was transferred to different wells of the plates containing the cells
previously seeded. After a total of 5 min of incubation, an additional 166.7 µL-aliquot
was removed from each tube and incubated in other wells on the same plate. As control,
the viral suspension was incubated in media without supplementation, with samples
collected at 2 and 5 min used to infect Vero cells on the same plate
The plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 for viral adsorption, and after
this period, 166.6 µL of DMEM High Glucose medium containing 12% fetal bovine
serum were added to each well, making to a final volume of 1 mL of medium/well
containing 2% serum. Immediately after adding the medium, the plate was further
incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2. After 48 h, the plate was removed from the incubator and
100 µL of the medium from each well (each well a different condition) was removed
and placed in lysis buffer to proceed with the viral RNA extraction. For the extraction,
the MagMAX™ CORE Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used,
following the manufacturer’s instructions, on the semi-automated platform MagMAX
Express-96 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The detection of viral RNA
was carried out using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an
ABI 7500 SDS real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems), using a published
protocol and sequence of primers and probe for E gene.[24] The number of RNA
copies/mL was quantified by real-time RT-qPCR using a specific in vitro-transcribed
RNA quantification standard, kindly granted by Christian Drosten, Charité Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany, as described previously.[25] The viricidal
activity, or viral inactivation, was determined as a percentage related to the control
(media without fabric specimen).
The experiment was repeated using the same experimental conditions, but with
media incubated with two pieces of test specimens (instead of one) per condition.
Assessment of Allergic Response
A Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT) was performed to determine the
absence of the potential for dermal irritability and sensitization of the treated fabrics.
The study was carried out in maximized conditions, in which semi-occlusive dressings
containing the investigational product and controls were applied to the participants'
backs. The application of the study dressings occurred for six weeks, with three weeks
of application alternately, two weeks of rest and a new application of the dressing
containing the product in virgin area in the sixth week (challenge). The readings of the
application site were performed at each dressing change according to the reading scale
recommended by the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG)[26].
Dermatological evaluations were carried out at the beginning and end of the study, and
a physician was available for evaluation and assistance to the participants in case of
positive or adverse reaction. Participants of both genders, with phototypes III to IV

Assessment of Dermatological Photoirrritant and Photosensitive Potential
Since exposure to solar radiation can trigger or aggravate adverse reactions to
topical products, knowing the behavior of the product on human skin stimulated with
ultraviolet radiation is of fundamental importance for proof of safety. Therefore, a
unicentric, blind, comparative clinical study to assess the photoirritating and
photosensitizing potential was also conducted, with the aim of proving the absence of
the irritating potential of the product applied to the skin when exposed to ultraviolet
radiation. The study was carried out with dressings containing the product, applied to
the participants' skin and, after removal, controlled irradiation with a spectrum of
ultraviolet radiation emission was performed. Readings were performed according to
the reading scale recommended by the ICDRG. The study with the participants lasted
for five weeks, covering 3 phases: induction, rest and challenge. Dermatological
evaluations were performed at the beginning and end of the study, or when there was an
indication of positivity or adverse reaction. Participants of both genders, with phototype
III (Fitzpatrick), aged between 21 and 62 were selected. The selected participants were
distributed as shown in the Table 3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There are numerous ways to functionalize a textile substrate, from the
development of new structures up to finishes that modify the material’s surface. The
superficial modification through the incorporation of nanoparticles has been extensively
studied and shows potential for obtaining devices with microbicidal activity.[28–33] In
this scenario, nanoparticles can advantageously replace micrometric particles used in
the finishes to obtain functional fabrics, because it has a greater surface area, resulting
in a better adhesion to fabrics and, consequently, greater durability of functionality.
Furthermore, it is possible to achieve a pronounced effect with small amounts of
material not altering the original properties of the fabric. Traditionally, the pad-dry-cure
is the most common finishing route applied to impart different finish treatments on
textile fabrics.[34,35] In this way, the interactions between the polycotton fabric and the

Ag NPs were investigated, in order to observe how these changes mirrored the
microbicidal properties in the new Ag-based fabric.
In order to analyze the local structural order/disorder caused by the addition of
Ag-based antimicrobials to polycotton, micro-Raman analyzes were performed. The
results are presented in Figure 1. The adhesion and durability of a superficial change in
fabrics depends on the surface chemical properties.[28] Since the main component of
polycotton is cotton (formed by glucose monomers) and polyester (polyethylene
terephthalate), the vibrations refer to C, O and H bonds. The cotton Raman spectra of
the samples can be divided into four blocks related to the glycosidic ring skeleton, to
OH groups, the CH and CH2 groups and acetylation of cotton. The glycosidic ring
presents the fingerprint of the cotton Raman spectra. These modes can be observed at
859, 1104, 1123 and 1183 cm-1 and represent the symmetrical stretching of C-O-C in
the plane, asymmetric and symmetrical stretching of C-O-C in the glycosidic link, and
asymmetric stretching of C-C ring breathing.[36] The presence of OH groups in the
samples is observed by the modes located at 287 and 1464 cm-1, related to the twisting
and deformation of the C-OH bonds.[37,38] Four modes related to CH2 deformations
and twisting are observed in 1000, 1291, 1372 and 1418 cm-1. There is still a mode
located at 289 cm-1 regarding the twisting of the C-CH bond.[39] The acetylation of the
cotton used is further confirmed by the modes located at 705 and 795 cm-1, referring to
deformation O-C=O and the stretching of the H3C-C bonds.[40] Like cotton, polyester
has its fingerprint given by the modes referring to its aromatic ring and its esters. It is
observed in 1613 cm-1 the mode referring to the stretching of the C1-C4 carbon of the
aromatic polyester ring, as well as its CH stretching in 3078 cm-1.[41,42] It is also
possible to observe in 1730 cm-1 the stretching of the C=O bonds of the esters and the
stretching of the CH bonds of the methyl groups external to the ring, in 2975 cm-1.[41–
43] It is observed that the addition of Ag-based antimicrobials do not cause significant
changes in the polycotton structure at short-range.

incorporation of the two Ag-based antimicrobial solutions into the polycotton (Figure
2). It is observed in the samples of pure polycotton and those modified with the Agbased antimicrobials the peaks located at 3540, 2936, 2124, 1947, 1710, 1338, 1147,
832 and 647 cm-1. The peaks located at 3540, 2936 and 2124 cm-1 refer to OH
stretching and CH deformation respectively, the latter being related to the CH2 groups
of the cellulose structure.[44,45] The peaks located in 1947, 1710, 1338 and 1147 cm-1
correspond respectively to H2O adsorbed on the polycotton surface, stretching of the
CH bond, asymmetric deformation of the C-O-C groups and were attributed to
stretching vibrations of intermolecular ester bonding.[45–47] As in the Raman spectra,
the cotton fingerprint can be observed in the FTIR due to the presence of the band
located at 832 cm-1, referring to the asymmetric stretching of the glycosidic ring,
especially the C1-O-C4 bonds.[46] It is observed for the modified polycotton in relation
to the non-treated polycotton the displacement of the band located at 1338 cm-1, as well
as the decrease of the band located around 647 cm-1, referent to in-plane bending of O-H
mode from the glycosidic units and deformation of the OH, respectively.[48,49] These
shifts, as well as the appearance of new bands in the FTIR spectra of the modified
polycotton are due to interactions between polycotton and Ag-based antimicrobial
additives.[50–52]

To observe morphological changes in polycotton fibers, FE-SEM measurements
were performed (Figure 3). There are no significant differences in the fiber diameters of
the samples, being the average diameter values obtained for the Non-Treated
Polycotton, Polycotton AgNP-CS and Polycotton AgNP-OP were 10.62 ± 2.30, 10.22 ±
2.04 and 10.59 ± 2.50 μm respectively. For Polycotton AgNP-CS (Figures 3d-f), it is
possible to observe the formation of small Ag nanoparticles on the polycotton surface,
with average size of the 23.51 ± 5.18 nm. Similar behavior was obtained by several
other authors in works that incorporated AgNPs into polycotton in different ways.[53–
60] For Polycotton AgNP-OP, the formation of a smaller amount of Ag nanoparticles
with average size higher (126.9 ± 19.5 nm) than the than Polycotton AgNP-CS were
observed. In addition, there is a homogeneous distribution of micrometric crystals with

well-defined morphology over all polycotton surface fibers, with an average size of 1.62
± 0.44 μm. These differences are due to the different composition of both Ag-based
antimicrobials, which result in different surface effects on polycotton surface fibers.

Figure 3. FE-SEM images of (a-c) Non-Treated Polycotton, (d-f) Polycotton AgNP-CS
and (g-i) Polycotton AgNP-OP.
Since Ag-based antimicrobial additives caused distinct surface interactions in
polycotton fibers, it is expected that this difference will be reflected in their physical,
chemical and biological properties. In this sense, experiments were carried out to
evaluate the biological properties of composites obtained through the allergenic
response to humans and microbicidal activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans and
SARS-CoV-2.
The AATCC 147 test results against S. aureus (gram positive) and E. coli
(gram negative) bacteria for the non-treated and the Ag-based antimicrobial treated
polycotton samples are shown in Figure 4 and Table 4. For the control polycotton,
growth of E. coli and S. aureus was observed under the specimen while no growth
appeared for the treated fabric. The zone of inhibition for the control sample was 0 mm,
in comparison to 2-3 mm for the treated fabric. It can be seen from these results that the
Ag-based antimicrobials treated fabrics displayed a high level of antibacterial
performance.

The antibacterial mechanism for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is
associated with Ag NPs and their penetration into the cell membrane of these
microorganisms. Ag NPs are able to penetrate cell membranes and release Ag+ ions,
which have a high affinity to react with phosphorus and sulfur compounds, either from
the membrane or from inside of the cell.[61] In addition, Ag NPs can generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which cause an accumulation of intracellular ROS, leading to
bacterial death from oxidative stress[62].

The halo inhibition test (AATCC 147) is only a qualitative test that shows
bacterial inhibition, requiring a qualitative test to determine the percentages of
inhibition (AATCC 100). The quantitative antimicrobial activities of finished textiles
treated with the two different Ag-based antimicrobials according to the AATCC 100
standard are shown in Table 5. These tests were also performed with C. albicans, in
order to assess the fungicidal potential of the Ag-based fabrics. In agreement with the
qualitative test, the quantitative test showed that all the Ag-based treated polycotton

The antiviral activity test was designed to determine the inactivation of viral
particles upon short exposure to the products, which in this case were the Ag-based
treated polycotton samples incubated in liquid media. After a short period of incubation,
the media were transferred to a cell culture, where viable virions would be able to enter
cells and replicate within. The supernatant of cell cultures was recovered after 48 h and
the viral load was determined by RT-qPCR, resulting in the determination of number of
viral RNA copies per mL.
Table 6 shows the number of copies of the control media without any fabric
sample, non-treated polycotton, and the two Ag-based treated polycotton samples at the
two different tested time periods. With the result of the number of copies of each
sample, the viral inactivation effect of each cloth was calculated, using the media
without any fabric sample as control.

Figure 6. Representative graph of the data obtained in the second experiment, relating
the tested products to the viral load found and the percentage of inhibition.
In both experiments, in the two time periods tested, the untreated polycotton
showed a subtle activity, which was already expected by data already published by Chin
and colleagues.[63] Polycotton AgNP-CS showed a high viricidal activity when
incubated with the virus. At both time periods in both experiments, Polycotton AgNPOP obtained a higher rate of viral inactivation compared to Polycotton AgNP-CS.
In short, both treated polycotton samples were effective in viral inhibition in 2
and 5 minutes in two different experiments, where there was variation in the amount of
virus per cm² of fabric (4x less virus/cm² in the second experiment). Polycotton AgNPOP showed the best activity, reaching 99.99% within two minutes of incubation with
the virus in the second experiment. Polycotton AgNP-CS, despite being less effective
than Polycotton AgNP-OP, showed high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with more than
80% inhibition rate in all tests performed.
As an antiviral agent, Ag NPs can interfere with viral replication by two separate
mechanisms of adhesion to the surface of the viral envelope. This adhesion prevents the
virus from being able to connect to the infecting cell, preventing contamination and
possible damage.[64,65] These antiviral mechanisms are mainly caused by stress in
infected cells (due to physical contact), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
interactions with DNA and enzymatic damage.[66] The first mechanism is through the
binding of Ag NPs with sulfur residues from the virus's surface glycoproteins,
preventing interaction with the receptor and its entry into the host cell.[67,68] The
second mechanism involves the passage of Ag NPs through the cell membrane that
consequently, it ends up effectively blocking the transcription factors necessary for the
adequate assembly of the viral progeny.[69] Thus, in addition to the unique behavior of

Ag NPs in isolation, its interface with polymers can be explored, which may open the
way for new ones promising applications in several fields of action.
Both the Human Repeat Insult Patch Test and the clinical study to assess the
photoirritating and photosensitizing potential were conducted according to the Cosmetic
Product Safety Assessment Guide, published by the Brazilian regulatory agency
ANVISA[70], by the ECOLYZER Group (São Paulo/SP, Brazil), an independent and
ISO certified laboratory. For the HRIPT, Primary Dermal Irritability, Accumulated
Dermal Irritability and Dermal Sensitization potential were determined. The clinical
evaluation criterion was the observation of clinical signs or symptoms such as swelling
(edema), redness (erythema), papules and vesicles according to the reading scale
recommended by the ICDRG. No adverse reactions (erythema, edema, papules or
vesicles) were detected in the product's application areas, in the analysis of primary and
accumulated irritability, sensitization, during the study period. The same clinical
evaluation criterion was used to determine the Dermal Photoirritation and Dermal
Photosensitization in the clinical study. As in the HRIPT, on this study no adverse
reactions (erythema, edema, papules or vesicles) were detected in the product's
application areas during the study period. According to the results obtained from the
sample of participants studied, we can conclude that the treated fabrics did not induce a
photoirritating, photosensitizing, irritation nor sensitization process and, therefore, can
be considered hypoallergenic and dermatologically tested and approved, being
considered safe, according to ANVISA's Guide for Cosmetic Product Safety.
CONCLUSIONS
Polycotton fabrics can be functionalized to attain antibacterial, antifungal and
antiviral properties using a simplistic and very common finishing treatment method in
nature, the pad-dry-cure. The use of an aqueous Ag NPs solution mixed with an acrylicbased binder was demonstrated to achieve a high level of antimicrobial performance and
can potentially present a high durability in relation to washing cycles as a result of the
use of the binder in the impregnation solution. FTIR and Raman analyzes showed
different surface effects on polycotton surface fibers due to the different chemical nature
of both tested antimicrobial finishing products. Additionally, the antimicrobial finishing
did not display significant differences in the fiber diameters of the samples, as shown by
the FE-SEM images. Therefore, this product had excellent universality in the
preparation, and it is expected that no significant change in fabric’s organoleptic
properties change, requiring no special condition for its use in a major scale. Future
experimental investigation would open new avenues to include the antiviral,
antibacterial and antifungal treatment to a wide variety of different surfaces in addition
to polycotton fabrics such as synthetic and natural fabrics, including cotton, polyesters
and polyamides. Beyond the scope of this work, this simple and facile antimicrobial
finishing treatment could be potentially scaled for industrial applications after
addressing challenges such as choosing appropriate processing conditions and
developing feasible waste disposition protocols. The main differential capability of
these Ag-based fabrics is the prevention of cross infection caused by pathogens, such as
opportunistic bacteria and fungi, responsible for the worsening of COVID-19 and other
types of viruses. The fabrication of these fabrics composed of these materials may
provide new insights into the development of protection garments and it is expected that
these new textile materials may play an outstanding role as a new and important weapon
against the current COVID-19 pandemic.

ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

This study focuses on the preparation of functional cotton with high and durable antibacterial activity
by in situ formation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) onto cotton fabric derived from phytic acid-Ag complex.
The route can be divided into two simple steps, adsorption of silver ions onto cellulose matrix with
phytic acid as a capture agent and subsequent reduction of Agþ to Ag NPs by sodium borohydride.
The successful deposition of Ag NPs on cotton fabric was verified by SEM, EDS and XPS. The bacterial
reduction rate against E. coli and S. aureus for the as-treated fabrics was above 99%, even after 10
laundry cycles. The phytic acid was found of benefit to distribution and bonding of silver on the cotton fabric, which might lead to the enhancement of antibacterial property and durability against

1. Introduction
Natural textiles, such as cotton and silk, have been widely
used in human’s life because of their outstanding properties,
like regeneration, softness and affinity to skin (Zhang, Toh,
Lin, & Chen, 2012). Currently, to cater to the need of market and improve human living standards, considerable
efforts have been devoted to functionalization of textiles,
endowing them with antimicrobial (Tian, Zhai, Xu, & Liang,
2017; Xu, Wu, Zhang, Fu, & Liu, 2016; Yu, Xu, Hu, Li, &
Wang, 2017), self-cleaning (Guo, Wen, Peng, & Guo, 2017;
Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), UV-blocking (Li, Zhu
et al., 2017; Noorian, Hemmatinejad, & Bashari, 2015;
Prasad, Arputharaj, Bharimalla, Patil, & Vigneshwaran,
2016; Rehan, Barhoum, et al., 2017), and flame-retardant
(Annalisa, Francesca, Giulio, Chiara, & Monica, 2016; Attia
& Morsy, 2016; Cheng, Guan, Tang, & Liu, 2016; Kundu
et al., 2017) properties. For cotton, which is seen as the
most extensively used and abundant natural cellulose material, the antimicrobial finishing is one of the most important
modifications, since the growth of microbes on cotton fabrics influenced not only their properties, but also the health
of human beings. Unfortunately, warm and moist environments and nutrients attachment are usually suitable for
microbe growth and reproduction on cotton fabric surface
(Zhang, Xu, Fu, & Liu, 2016).
Up to now, various antimicrobial agents are applied,
such as quaternary ammonium compounds (Kim, Kim, &

Textile; cotton; antimicrobial
activity; Ag nanoparticle;
phytic acid

Rhee, 2010; Lin et al., 2018), inorganic nanoparticles (NPs)
(Mihailovic et al., 2010), triclosan (Foksowicz-Flaczyk,
Walentowska, Przybylak, & Maciejewski, 2016), N-halamines
(Tian et al., 2017), chitosan and its derivatives (Bhuiyan,
Hossain, Zakaria, Islam, & Uddin, 2017; Xu et al., 2016), to
tackle this weakness of cotton. The loading of inorganic
nanoparticles, including silver, copper and some metallic
oxides, has recently become a popular way to produce antimicrobial cotton fabrics (Manna, Goswami, Shilpa, Sahu, &
Rana, 2015; Pivec, Hribernik, Kolar, & Kleinschek, 2017;
Suryaprabha & Sethuraman, 2017). Among all the NPs
applied, Ag NPs have the advantages of low toxicity and
excellent antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria (Le Ouay & Stellacci, 2015; Li,
Meng et al., 2017; Becenen & Altun, 2018). To sum up,
three methods are used to prepare Ag NPs-coated textiles,
including spinning fibers with synthesized polymer-nanoparticle composites (Gao, Wang, Xu, & Xu, 2014), ex situ
(Attia & Morsy, 2016; Xu et al., 2016), and in situ (Emam,
Saleh, Nagy, & Zahran, 2015; Yazdanshenas & ShateriKhalilabad, 2012) synthesis of nanoparticles onto the fabric
surfaces. Because of the excellent stability and uniform distribution on textile as well as the eco-friendly process, in
situ synthesis of Ag NPs on fabrics hence aroused attention,
in which the silver ions are firstly absorbed onto the fabrics
and subsequently reduced into Ag NPs (Li, Meng et al.,
2017; Zhang et al., 2012). And some other works presented
in situ deposition of Ag NPs into cotton fibers directly in

alkaline environment and high temperature, which used cellulosic groups as reducing and stabilizing agent (Emam
et al., 2015; Yazdanshenas & Shateri-Khalilabad, 2012).
These methods, however, suffer from obvious limitation of
low density of loaded Ag NPs due to the limited Agþ-binding sites on the cotton fibers, meanwhile, the bonding
between the hydroxyl groups and Ag NPs in the fibers is
always weak that leads to poor washing durability. In order
to solve the above problems, Rehan et al. modified cotton
surface by cationization and partial carboxymethylation, and
achieved formation of Ag NPs on the modified samples
using trisodium citrate as both the reducer and stabilizing
agent (Rehan, Zaghloul, Mahmoud, Montaser, & Hebeish,
2017). Zhang et al. used amino-terminated hyper-branched
polymer (HBP-NH2) as reducer and stabilizer to prepare
amino functional Ag NPs, which were then grafted onto the
pre-oxidized cotton fabrics to obtain excellent antibacterial
property (Zhang, Chen, Zang, Chen, & Lin, 2013). However,
these approaches may be not suitable for practical application due to their long reaction time and chemical consuming. Moreover, some used polymers are toxic and difficult
to degradation (Meng et al., 2016). Therefore, the development of a simple and green approach for efficient formation
of Ag NPs on textiles is urgent.
In this study, we used phytic acid (myo-inositol
1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate, PA) as a capture and stabilizing agent to prepare Ag NPs-coated cotton fabrics through
in situ synthesis strategy. The silver ions were first adsorbed
onto cellulose matrix in the presence of PA and subsequently reduced to Ag NPs by sodium borohydride. As a
green and natural composition of plant, PA was widely
found in nuts, pollens, fruits, legumes, oil seeds and vegetables (Zhou et al., 2017). Its six phosphate groups can provide enough binding sites for silver ions, which enhance the
bonding of Agþ on cotton surface; meanwhile, the presence
of PA could increase steric hindrance and electrostatic
repulsion among the nanoparticles, resulting in good distribution. To the best of our knowledge, PA combined with
Ag NPs used in antimicrobial finishing has not yet been
reported. The antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S.
aureus and durability against repetitive washing of the
PA@Ag NPs decorated cotton were well investigated.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was purchased from Aladdin Ind.,
Co. (Shanghai, China). Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and
sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were supplied by Damao
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). All the above
reagents were of analytical grade and used as purchased
without further purification. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, ATCC 6538) and Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC 25922)
were purchased from Guangdong Institute of Microbiology.
Phytic acid (70 wt.%) was bought from Yuanye Biological
Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cotton fabric was
obtained from a local market.

2.2. In situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles on
cotton fabric
Raw cotton (RC) was cleaned using solution made of 2 g/L
sodium carbonate and 2 g/L commercial detergent at 60  C
for 30 min with fabric-to-liquor ratio of 1:50. The fabrics
were subsequently washed twice with deionized water and
dried at room temperature.
For the preparation of cotton/PA/Ag fabrics (CPAF), a
piece of washed cotton fabric (3  3 cm2) was firstly impregnated in 30 mL of PA solution (0.01 mol/L) for 2 min. The
sample was then taken out and immersed into 30 mL of
AgNO3 solution (0.1 mol/L) for another 2 min. The assembly
was obtained by repeating three cycles of alternately impregnating the sample into the PA solution and AgNO3 solution.
After washed with deionized water and dried at 80  C, the
treated cotton fabric was further impregnated in 50 mL of
the sodium borohydride solution (0.1 mol/L) for 30 min.
Finally, the treated sample was washed with deionized water
and dried at 80  C. Control experiment was performed similar as the CPAF while without the PA immersion steps,
forming cotton/Ag fabrics (CAF).
2.3. Antibacterial test
The antibacterial activity of the treated fabrics against the S.
aureus and the E. coli were assessed according to ASTM
E2149-01 (Bhuiyan et al., 2017). Typically, about 33 g of
agar powders were dissolved in a 1 L flask containing
250 mL of distilled water and subsequently heated to boil to
be completely dissolved. The 250 mL flask was sterilized for
15 min in an autoclave at 121  C. Then, the agar was
sampled in culture dishes. For each fabric sample, 0.1 g fabrics were cut into small pieces (1  1 cm2) and put into a
250-mL flask containing 50 mL of the bacterial dilution
(1.5–6.0  105 CFU/mL). All flasks were placed on a shaking
incubator and were shaken for 1 h at 37  C. A series of dilutions were prepared with the buffer solution (0.3 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and each 0.1 mL of the dilution was
placed into a nutrient agar plate. The inoculated plates were
then incubated in an incubator at 37  C for 18–24 h and
surviving cells were counted. The antimicrobial activity was
expressed in terms of % reduction of the microorganism
after contact with the test specimen using Eq. (1).
% Reduction ¼ ðB  AÞ=B  100%

where A and B are the surviving cells (CFU/mL) for the
flasks containing test samples and raw cotton respectively
after 1 h contact time.
2.4. Wash fastness test
Wash fastness of CPAF was estimated by home laundry
washing method (Emam, Saleh, Nagy, & Zahran, 2016). In
detail, cotton fabrics were impregnated in the solution
including 2 g/L sodium carbonate and 2 g/L commercial
detergent with fabric-to-liquor ratio of 1:50 at 60 ± 5  C for
15 min with stirring. After each laundering, the samples

THE JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE

were softly squeezed and washed with water and subsequently dried at 70 ± 5  C. CPAF-10L samples were obtained
by repeating the process 10 times. The durability of the
CPAF samples was evaluated by determination of silver content after 10 times of washing.

treated fabrics was quantitatively determined using a Hitachi
Z-2000 atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS).

2.5. Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-S8220) was
applied to observe the surface morphology of fabrics, at
5 kV accelerating voltage. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis unit (20 mm X-Max detector) attached
with the electron microscope was used for elemental analysis. Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer was used to
investigate the chemical compositions of the fabrics in the
attenuated total reflection mode. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were acquired using a Rigaku SmartLab SE
X-ray Diffractometer over the 2h range from 10 to 80 . Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on a PHI-5000C ESCA XPS spectrometer with Al
Ka radiation in order to evaluate the chemistry and bonding
variations of the fabrics. The total content of Ag in the

Figure 1. Schematic of the preparation of CPAF.

The preparation of CPAF could be schematically described
in Figure 1. The cotton fabrics were firstly impregnated into
PA and AgNO3 solution sequentially to form phytic acid-Ag
complexes (PA-Agþ) on cotton fabrics (SEM image can be
seen in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Information). PA
has six negatively charged phosphate groups which has a
strong tendency to integrate with positively charged metal
ions (Cheng, Guan, Chen, Yang, & Tang, 2016). Hence, PA
can act as a capture agent to deliver silver ions onto cotton
textile which provides enough binding sites for silver ions,
resulting in considerable Ag NPs formation in the subsequent reduction step. As the cotton fabric was impregnated
into PA solution, the fabric fibers may adsorb the PA molecules by covalent bond between the phosphate group and
abundant –OH groups of the fabric surface (Pujari, Scheres,
Marcelis, & Zuilhof, 2014). When the fabric was further
impregnated into the AgNO3 solution, the PA would

combine with Ag ions by electrostatic interaction on fibers
tightly to form PA-Agþ complexes aggregations. PA-Agþ
complexes were grown by the assembly method, where
more PA molecules were deposited subsequently via chelating reactions with the help of Ag ions adsorbed. Finally,
Agþ ions on PA-Agþ complexes were reduced by NaBH4 as
explained in reaction (2):

After this step of treatment, the color of the fabric turned
from white to yellow (Figure S2), indicating the effective
reduction of Ag (I) ions to Ag (0).
The surface morphologies of RC and CPAF were studied
by SEM as depicted in Figure 2. The surface of raw
cotton is smooth with numerous folds embedded in fiber
(Figure 2(a,b)). Compared with the smooth and clean surface of raw cotton, a large amount of particles on the cotton
fibers of CPAF are clearly visible in Figure 2(c,d), indicating
the successful deposition of Ag NPs. Compared to the fabric
that treated without PA (Figure S3), more nano-sized silver
particles are evenly dispersed on the surface of CAPF. On
the other hand, the particle size distribution of Ag NPs on

the cotton fibers in presence of PA from SEM images
was located between 58.6 ± 14.7 nm (Figure 2(e)), smaller
than that previously recorded in literature (89.0 ± 41.2 nm)
(Rehan, Mowafi, Aly, Elshemy, & Haggag, 2017), whereas
on the cotton fibers in absence of PA was in the range of
128.9 ± 57.6 nm (Figure S4). Silvers had the tendency to
agglomerate together to form larger clusters without PA as
shown in Figure S3. These results indicated the importance
of PA for its ability to capture Ag ions and stabilize Ag
NPs, because PA has a strong tendency to combine with Ag
ions and could increase steric hindrance and electrostatic
repulsion among Ag NPs.
The surface chemical elements of CPAF were determined
by EDS as depicted in Figure 2(f). The raw cotton contains
only C and O elements, while the peak of Ag and P can be
observed in CPAF. The extra peak at about 1.5 keV belongs
to aluminum, which came from the Al platform used for
supporting the fabric sample during measurement (it was
excluded when investigating the elementary contents). As
shown in Table S1, the content of Ag in CPAF is 8.12 wt.%
detected by EDS. The EDS mapping images of CPAF show
that Ag NPs were homogeneously deposited on the CPAF
surface (inset of Figure 2(f)).

ATR-FTIR spectra were used to identify the chemical
components on the surface of cotton fabric samples. As
depicted in Figure 3(a), the absorption peaks around
1000–1200 cm1 are related to the C–O stretching of the
cellulose matrix (Chung, Lee, & Choe, 2004). The characteristic peaks of cellulose macromolecule are observed at
around 3339 cm1 (O–H stretching), 2893 cm1 (C–H
stretching), 1634 cm1 (C ¼ O stretching), 1427 cm1 (C–H
wagging) and 1367 cm1 (C–H bending) for cotton fabrics

either untreated or treated. Moreover, the peak at
1634 cm1 becomes a little broader after the incorporation
of PA-Ag NPs complex into the cotton. The characteristic
peak of the –PO43– at about 1100 cm1 presented to be
overlapped by the C–O band. Additionally, stretching frequencies of the P ¼ O groups which come from –HPO42– in
the fabrics containing with PA appear to be overlapped by
the C ¼ O band near 1634 cm1 (Zhou et al., 2017).
Furthermore, new peaks were not observed in the spectra of
treated samples compared to raw cotton, which demonstrated no chemical reaction happened on cotton fabrics
during the deposition of Ag NPs.
The XRD patterns of cotton fabrics were acquired to
investigate the structural information. As depicted in Figure
3(b), the diffraction peaks at 2h ¼ 14.8 , 16.5 , 22.6 , and
34.4 are characteristic peaks of cellulose I crystalline form,
which can be seen in all the samples, confirming the state of
crystalline cellulose I does not change after in situ deposition of Ag NPs (Li, Meng et al., 2017). In CPAF, a new
sharp peak can be noticed at 2h ¼ 38.2 , corresponding to
the lattice plane of 111 of metallic silver with face centered
cubic symmetry (Ahmed & Emam, 2016), proving the successful fabrication of metallic Ag on cotton fabrics. On the
other hand, diffraction peaks characteristic for impurities
such as Ag2O were not observed.
The chemical information of the surface of cotton
samples was further examined by XPS, as shown in
Figure 3(c,d). Compared with the wide scan XPS spectrum
of raw cotton, a new binding energy near 366–368.0 eV that

is attributed to Ag 3d was found in CPAF (Figure 3(c)),
indicating the successful deposition of silver on the surface
of cotton fabrics. From the high resolution XPS spectra of
Ag 3d in Figure 3(d), the binding energies of two peaks at
368.1 eV and 374.1 eV are related to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag
3d3/2, respectively, with a spin-orbit separation of 6.0 eV
(Cong et al., 2014). Both the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 characteristic peaks belong to the Ag0 species, which presents a
certain proof that the nanoparticles on the cotton fibers are
indeed Ag0 particles.
3.2. Antimicrobial activity and laundering durability
Antimicrobial activity of the cotton samples was assessed
qualitatively using a ASTM E2149-01 method by investigating the bacterial reduction rate (R%). To estimate the antibacterial activity of cotton samples, we selected the S. aureus
and the E. coli as target bacteria and the results were presented in Figure 4 and Table S2. As shown in Figure 4, the
raw cotton did not exhibit any antimicrobial action, while
the antibacterial activity was seen in CPAF samples, proving
the remarkable antibacterial activity of CPAF. Moreover, the
bacterial reduction rate of S. aureus and E. coli for cotton
fabrics treated with Ag NPs in the presence of PA is higher
than that for the fabrics treated without PA (Table 1 and
Table S3), indicating greater fixation of the silver nanoparticles in the presence of PA.
For antibacterial fabrics are applicable products, the durability against wash is interestedly concerned. As demonstrated in Table 1, after 10 washing cycles, the bacterial
reduction of CPAF against both S. aureus and E. coli is still
higher than 99%. Figure S5 showed the surface morphologies of treated fabrics after 10 laundering cycles and demonstrated the remaining of Ag NPs on fabrics. The percentage
loss of Ag contents of CPAF is 14.2% after washing (Table
S3), which was lower than that recorded previously in literature (Cheng, Guan, Chen, et al., 2016; Le Ouay & Stellacci,
2015; Pivec et al., 2017). Whereas the Ag loss of cotton fabric treated without PA after 10 times of washing was 78.9%.
Apparently, these results prove the superior degree of fixation of Ag NPs exhibited by CPAF, suggesting that PA
could stabilize Ag NPs and keep them staying within its
structure to provide a necessary durable release of silver
essential for antimicrobial activity.

4. Conclusion
This study has developed a simple, facile and time-saving route
to fabricate cotton fabrics with outstanding antimicrobial

activity by in situ deposition of Ag NPs into cotton fabric
matrix in combination with environmental benign PA, which
plays an important dual role as both capture agent for Agþ
and stabilizing agent for the formed Ag NPs. The obtained
fabrics exhibited excellent and durable antibacterial activities
against both S. aureus and E. coli. After 10 laundering cycles,
the bacterial reduction rate for CPAF was still above 99%. The
results of AAS, SEM, EDS, FTIR, XRD and XPS confirmed
that the silver nanoparticles have been fixed and well dispersed
on the cotton fibers at the chemical state of Ag0 with size distribution between 58.6 ± 14.7 nm. The PA was of benefit to Ag
distribution and bonding on the fabric with a consecutive
enhancement in antibacterial properties and durability
against wash.

Abstract: Heterostructures based on ZnO-TiO2 /delaminated montmorillonite coated with Ag have
been prepared by sol–gel and photoreduction procedures, varying the Ag and ZnO contents.
They have been thoroughly characterized by XRD, WDXRF, UV–Vis, and XPS spectroscopies,
and N2 adsorption, SEM, and TEM. In all cases, the montmorillonite was effectively delaminated
with the formation of TiO2 anatase particles anchored on the clay layer’s surface, yielding porous
materials with high surface areas. The structural and textural properties of the heterostructures
synthesized were unaffected by the ZnO incorporated. The photoreduction led to solids with
Ag nanoparticles decorating the surface. These materials were tested as photocatalysts for the
degradation of several emerging contaminants with different nitrogen-bearing chemical structures
under solar light. The catalysts yielded high rates of disappearance of the starting pollutants and
showed quite stable performance upon successive applications.

1. Introduction
The development of porous heterostructures based on clay minerals (PCHs) has attracted
researchers specially to develop nanoporous materials with predesigned properties for catalytic
applications as an alternative to zeolites. In this context, pillared clays (PILCs) were the first studied
systems, being prepared by an intercalation of metal-oxopolycations (typically based on aluminum) and
subsequently submitted to thermal treatment to consolidate pillars of the metal oxide [1,2]. PILCs have
been studied as catalysts because they present high permanent porosity, where the distributed pillars
determine, in an ideal perspective, a two-dimensional channel system consisting of micropores
comparable to those of zeolites [3]. The possibility of using different types of pillaring agents as
well as layered clays of different origins allows for the preparation of PILCs with channels of variable
width and pillars of different nature, with potential applications as catalysts in different reactions [4].
Afterwards, new approaches were intended to create other porous clay-derived materials, such as
the one reported by Pinnavaia’s group called Porous Clay Heterostructures (PCHs) [5]. This method is
based on a templated synthesis where a surfactant and a cosurfactant are initially intercalated between
the clay layers, changing the hydrophobicity of the clay and creating micelles in the interlayer space.
Then, a silicon-alkoxide was incorporated and its further hydrolysis and polymerization was controlled
to occur around the micelles. Thus, the silica formed was templated by the micelle, generating silica

pillars with a very well-ordered pattern. This methodology has been usually employed to prepare
mesoporous silica, with modulate and larger porosity than that achievable by common pillaring
strategies [6,7]. The interest of this approach has been extended to the preparation of PCHs involving
other atoms than Si, such as Al or Ti, which introduce other functional applications related to catalysis
and adsorption [8–10].
More recently, a new type of materials related to PILCs and PCHs has been prepared on the basis
of oxide nanoparticles (NPs) between delaminated clay sheets, which have been named Delaminated
Porous Clay Heterostructures (DPCHs) [11]. This approach uses an organoclay as starting material,
which is dispersed in an alcohol, allowing the expansion of the organoclay and the incorporation of
alkoxides. Later, the addition of controlled amounts of water provokes the heterocoagulation of the
expanded organoclay while the alkoxide is hydrolyzed, giving rise to NPs that remain assembled to the
clay network [12,13]. Earlier studies were made on SiO2 - and SiO2 -Al2 O3 DPCHs [14], but this strategy
has been also applied to prepare TiO2 -based DPCHs with photocatalytic applications [15,16].
The investigations on TiO2 -based DPCHs as photocatalysts suggest that the clay can affect the
phase of the semiconductor, the size of the NPs formed, and the textural properties of the resulting
material. Recent works have demonstrated that the efficiency of these TiO2 -DPCHs photocatalysts
can be improved by doping the TiO2 with transition metals or creating TiO2 -ZnO heterojunctions
by a similar synthetic approach that anchors these semiconductors on a delaminated-clay [17–19].
These results confirm that the DPCHs’ synthesis can be successfully modulated to obtain photocatalysts
active for the degradation of different organic pollutants, with an improved visible absorption capacity
and quantum yield. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel Ag/ZnO-TiO2 /delaminated clay
combining the semiconductor properties of the TiO2 -ZnO heterojunctions with the light absorption
properties of Ag and the porous texture of the delaminated clay. The main aim is to create photocatalysts
with enhanced efficiency towards the degradation of emerging contaminants under solar light.
Based on the literature, several clay-based photocatalysts have been reported using layered
montmorillonites and TiO2 as active phase. Most of them include TiO2 -PILCs with high surface
areas, which have demonstrated high decolorization rates for model dyes under UV light. However,
these materials have the TiO2 hindering between the clay layers, being an important drawback for
their technological application [20]. In fact, the application of TiO2 -PILCs for the photodegradation
of emerging contaminants is not so extended. In this context, different strategies are under study
to improve the efficiency of layered clay-based photocatalysts. They are mainly focused on the
improvement of the porosity by delaminating the structure, and the anchorage of other semiconductors,
such as ZnO, Bi2 O3 , silver halides, and other ternary oxides [20], being necessary to study the relation
between the semiconductors and clay materials for the photocatalytic reaction.
In this scenario, the DPCHs appear as a promising way to develop photocatalysts with high
efficiency. The identification and removal of these pollutants from water receives nowadays special
attention. So far, there is no discharge limitation or regulatory status and their effects on human health
and the environment are still under study. Among them, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, or personal care
products, which of extended world-wide use are appearing in many aquatic environments as well
as in wastewater treatment plants, where they are difficult to remove [21,22]. Different technologies
are currently under study for these water pollutants, one of them being photocatalysis. It is based on
the ability of a semiconductor material to generate electron–hole pairs induced by the absorption
of light with an energy greater than its band gap. These charges can be involved in redox reactions
allowing the oxidation of many organic molecules [23,24]. This technology appears as a promising
way to remove different pollutants because it opens the chance of using solar light as an energy source.
The current work focuses its attention on the degradation of pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen and
antipyrine) and pesticide (atrazine) as model emerging contaminants because of their frequent use by
the population and their impact on the environment [21].

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of Ag/ZnO-TiO2 /Clay Materials
The preparation of Ag/ZnO-TiO2 /clay materials follows the heterocoagulation procedure described
for TiO2 -DPCHs in the literature [16,19]. Summarizing, 1 g of a commercial organo-montmorillonite
(Cloisite® 30B supplied by Southern Clay Products, Gonzales, TX, USA) was dispersed in 10 mL of
2-propanol (Panreac, Castellar del Vallès, Spain) under stirring at 50 ◦ C for 24 h. A solution of titanium
(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 2-propanol (70% v/v) was slowly added to
the clay suspension under stirring, fixing the TiO2 /clay weight ratio at 2/1. After 15 min, an aqueous
solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added dropwise to the
slurry, varying the amount of zinc acetate to obtain ZnO-TiO2 ratios from 0 to 2% (w/w). The mixture
was kept at 50 ◦ C under stirring until a gel was formed due to the sol–gel transition of the titanium
precursor. The gel was first dried at 60 ◦ C for 24 h and the resulting solid was annealed in air at
500 ◦ C for 4 h (with a 5 ◦ C min−1 heating rate), thus removing the organic compounds coming from the
organo-montmorillonite and the metal precursors. By this way, several ZnO-TiO2 /delaminated clay solids
were prepared.
The incorporation of silver particles was carried out by photoreduction [25]. The appropriate amount
of the ZnO-TiO2 /delaminated clay previously prepared was added to 50 mL of ethanol solution of AgNO3 ,
maintaining magnetic stirring for 30 min to ensure the adsorption of the Ag+ ions on the solid surface.
The suspension was further irradiated at 25 ◦ C with a commercial UV lamp (TecnoLite G15T8, 214 nm, 17 W,
Jalisco, Mexico) for 1 h under stirring. Afterwards, the solid was separated by filtration and dried for 18 h at
100 ◦ C. The silver amount was adjusted to 1 and 3 wt % Ag. The final delaminated montmorillonite-coated
materials were labeled 1C2T-ZnX-AgY, being X the amount of ZnO incorporated (0.5, 1, 2 wt %) and Y the
silver amount deposited (1 and 3 wt %). The solid without ZnO (0 wt % used as reference) was named
1C2T-Ag1 following the same label as that in our previous works [16–18].
2.2. Characterization of the Solids
The crystal structure of the samples was analyzed with a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Billerica, MA,
USA) equipped with a Sol-X energy dispersive detector to obtain the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.
Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 2◦ –70◦ with a scanning rate of 1.5◦ min−1 was used. The average
crystal size (D) was estimated from the (101) diffraction peak of the anatase phase, the most intense
peak, using Scherrer’s equation. Wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF)
was used to determine quantitatively the chemical composition (major and trace elements) of the
samples prepared using S8 Tiger Bruker equipment (Billerica, MA, USA). The porous texture of the
samples was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 ◦ C using a Micromeritics TriStar 123
apparatus (Norcross, GA, USA). The samples were previously outgassed under vacuum at 150 ◦ C for
at least 8 h. The total surface area (SBET ) was quantified by the BET method [26], while the external or
nonmicroporous surface area (SEXT ) and the micropore volume (VMP ) were estimated using the t-plot
method [27]. Finally, the total pore volume (VT ) was calculated from the amount of nitrogen (as liquid)
adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99.
The band gap values were obtained from the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) carried
out on a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer (model UV-2600, Tokyo, Japan), with an integrating
sphere in the 200–900 nm region, using BaSO4 as reference material and the Tauc Plot standard
procedure [28]. The representation of (F(R) × hυ)1/2 versus hυ (eV) yields a graph with a linear
region whose extrapolation to the x axis gives the band gap value. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to study the surface composition of the catalysts. The XPS spectra were recorded on
a K-Alpha-Thermo Scientific spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA) using Al Kα X-ray (1486.68 eV) as
the excitation source. Binding energies corresponding to Ag 3d, Zn 2p, Ti 2p, and O 1s electrons were
obtained using as reference the C 1s line, which was taken as 284.6 eV. The fitting of the XPS signals was
made by the least-squares method using peaks with Gaussian–Lorentzian shapes. Scanning electron

microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800, Tokyo, Japan) using secondary electron (SE) and backscattered
electron (BSE) detectors was employed for the analysis of the morphology and particle size of the
photocatalysts. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a TEM 200 kV,
Tecnai G220 from FEI COMPANY (Hillsboro, OR, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
2.3. Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic degradation tests were performed using antipyrine (phenazone), acetaminophen
(paracetamol), or atrazine (Pestanal® ) as model compounds. Their respective chemical structures can be
seen in Figure S1 of the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI). The reactions were carried out in
500 mL Pyrex glass reactors (Panreac, Castellar del Vallès, Spain), with two different ports for sampling
and flowing air (50 mL min−1 ), under vigorous magnetic stirring. For the tests, these glass reactors
were introduced inside a Suntest solar simulator (Suntest XLS+ photoreactor, ATLAS, Mount Prospect,
IL, USA) equipped with a 765–250 W m−2 Xe lamp which simulates solar radiation. More details of
the photocatalytic reaction system are given elsewhere [16]. In a typical experiment, 250 mg L−1 of
catalyst (Ag/ZnO-TiO2 /clay) were added to 200 mL aqueous solution containing 5 mg L−1 of the
corresponding target compound. Before the photocatalytic reaction, the solution was stirred in dark
overnight to achieve an adsorption equilibrium. After that, the suspension was exposed to solar irradiation
for 6 h. The irradiation intensity was fixed at 450 W m−2 , and the reaction temperature was monitored to
achieve a constant value of 38 ± 1 ◦ C. At given time intervals, 8 mL of the suspension were withdrawn and
the photocatalyst was removed by filtration using nylon fiber filters (0.45 µm, Tecknokroma, Sant Cugat del
Vallès, Spain). The liquid phase was analyzed by HPLC using a Varian Pro-Start 410 with a UV–vis detector
(ProStart 325, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a reversed phase C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). A mixture of acetonitrile/acetic acid 0.1% v/v (gradient method: 10/90–40/60% (0–18 min)) was
used as the mobile phase, with a constant flow of 0.35 mL min−1 . The wavelength used for the detection
of each compound was 256, 246, and 270 nm (antipyrine, acetaminophen, and atrazine, respectively).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of ZnO-TiO2 /Delaminated Montmorillonite Coated with Ag
When the organo-montmorillonite is dispersed in an alcoholic medium it expands, favoring the
intercalation of the titanium precursor. Therefore, the subsequent hydrolysis and condensation upon
water addition occur between the clay layers, giving rise to the clay delamination. This procedure
has been previously reported for several titania and doped-titania solids [16–18], being a simple and
reproducible way to synthesize delaminated porous clay heterostructures. The delamination suffered
by the organo-montmorillonite is seen in the X-ray diffractograms depicted in Figure 1. The raw
organo-montmorillonite shows a very intense (001) reflection peak at 1.8 nm (characteristic of this
organoclay) that disappears after the incorporation of the titania phase (see 1C2T-Ag1 sample). The lack
of the (001) reflection comes with the loss of other (001) reflections, indicating that the montmorillonite
sheets are disordered in the c-direction, which can be then associated to its delamination. However,
at the same time, it maintained the characteristic layered structure, since the other reflections remained
unchanged. This trend was maintained when adding ZnO to the synthesis mixture, so that all of the
solids prepared can be described as delaminated clay heterostructures.

Table 2 summarizes the characterization of the porous texture of the solids. It confirms the
significant increase of the specific surface area (SBET ) of the 1C2T heterostructure with respect to
the starting organo-montmorillonite, due to its delamination, which makes accessible both the
inner and outer surface of the clay layers [16]. The surface area values are within those previously
reported for this kind of DPCH [14,16]. The incorporation of a higher ZnO amount yields a different
porous development, as indicated by the increasing values of surface areas and pore volumes
(1C2T-Zn0.5-Ag1 < 1C2T-Zn1-Ag1 < 1C2T-Zn2-Ag1). This fact could be associated to the generation
of a more disordered porous network, probably related to the different heterocoagulation process
occurring upon the sol-gel transition, as indicated before. Regarding Ag incorporation, the values of
the surface areas and pore volumes of the corresponding solids confirm the aforementioned partial
blockage of porosity by the Ag particles.

The DRS-UV–visible spectra of the samples (Figure 3A) show that the characteristic band in the
UV region is below 360 nm from the charge transference of TiO2 , with the absorption edge around
380 nm [34,35]. These profiles also display an absorption shoulder in the visible region, with a maximum
at 480 nm, that could be associated to the surface plasmon absorption characteristic of the Ag0 particles
coating on the solid surface [36]. This absorption shoulder clearly differs according to the ZnO content of
the solid, resulting in a sharper absorption in the visible region when the ZnO increases from 0.5 to 2%.
This effect suggests a certain type of interaction between the ZnO and the Ag incorporated. Moreover,
increasing the silver content from 1 to 3% results in a broader absorption in the visible region, now with the
maximum at 510 nm, due to the surface plasmon of the higher silver content. The band gap values (Table 2)
were estimated by the Tauc Plot approximation (Figure 3B) considering that these materials are indirect
semiconductors as TiO2 (their main component) [37]. All of the heterostructures yielded band gap values
that were very close together, around 3.2–3.3 eV, without important changes due to the incorporation of
the ZnO because both semiconductors, TiO2 and ZnO, are characterized by energy band gap values of
3.2 and 3.2–3.4 eV, respectively. Unlike in some other work [38], here the heterojunction made in these
solids between TiO2 and ZnO did not modify the energy band structure of the final heterostructures.

4. Conclusions
Novel heterostructures based on a ZnO-TiO2 /delaminated montmorillonite coated with Ag
nanoparticles, with different ZnO and Ag loads, were successfully synthesized by sol-gel and
further photoreduction. The structural characterization revealed, in all cases, the delamination of the
montmorillonite and the crystallization of TiO2 anatase anchored on the surface of the clay layers.
The fixation of ZnO and Ag was confirmed by chemical analyses and XPS, although without the
formation of any crystallized phase. The resulting heterostructures exhibited high surface areas
with a contribution from both micro- and mesopores. The surface characterization revealed the
presence of silver as both Ag+ and Ag0 at surface concentrations, and the relative amounts were
unchanged regardless of the total amount coated. The presence of silver nanoparticles induced the
light absorption of the solids in the visible region. These Ag particles displayed an average size of
25–30 nm, showing monodisperse size distributions. All of these heterostructures were effective for the
photodegradation of antipyrine under solar light, being 1C2T-Zn0.5-Ag1 the most active. Its efficiency
was similar for the three different chemical structures tested as model emerging contaminants
(antipyrine, acetaminophen, and atrazine, this last containing also chlorine). The most active catalyst
(1C2T-Zn0.5-Ag1) was tested in three successive runs, showing almost unaltered performance.

ABSTRACT: ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) were fabricated on polyester fabrics (PFs) by a two-step method and modiﬁed with Ag
by magnetron sputtering. The photogenerated charge transport properties of the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunctions were studied by
a self-made Kelvin probe system and a surface photovoltage (SPV) test system. The measured work functions (WFs) of the
deposited Ag and ZnO nanorod are 4.67 and 5.56 eV, respectively. The SPV spectra indicate that the direction of the inner electric
ﬁeld is from the Ag layer to the inner of the ZnO nanorod. The enhancement of light absorption by the local surface plasma
resonance (LSPR) eﬀect of Ag/ZnO NRA was observed by Raman microspectroscopy and UV−vis diﬀuse reﬂectance spectroscopy.
The photocatalytic activity of the Ag/ZnO NRA-functionalized PFs was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine
B (RB) solution under visible light. The full photo-oxidation of RB and the outperforming ZnO NRA-coated PFs demonstrate that
the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PFs results from the cooperation of the inner electric ﬁeld of the
Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction and Ag LSPR.

1. INTRODUCTION
With social and economic development, especially the
continuous rapid expansion of industrial production all over
the world, water pollution has become an increasingly serious
worldwide problem. Various pollutants in water have reverse
impacts and potential risks on human health and even the
whole ecosystem. Therefore, it is urgent to ﬁnd solutions to the
sewage treatment problem. Photocatalysis is an advanced
oxidation process and is used to degrade pollutants into H2O,
CO2, and other non-toxic materials.1,2 In recent decades, the
photocatalytic function of oxide semiconductors has brought
about widespread attention to its broader potential for
application in the degradation of organic pollutants. Various
photocatalysts based on semiconductors such as TiO2, SnO2,
and ZnO have been widely reported in the recent studies.3−5
Among them, ZnO is widely employed to deal with organic
water pollution issues because of its low cost, extensive source,
safety for use, and thermal and photochemical stability.6,7
However, the fast recombinations of photogenerated electrons
and holes in monolayer ZnO decrease the quantum yield
greatly, which leads to its poor photocatalytic performance.

Furthermore, ZnO has a wide energy band gap (∼3.2 eV),
which limits the absorption spectra to the narrow ultraviolet
region. As a result, the ZnO monolayer has rarely been
reported as an eﬃcient photocatalyst. In order to overcome the
above-mentioned intrinsic weaknesses of ZnO and improve its
photocatalytic performance, various strategies, such as the
synthesis of nanostructure meterials and formation of
heterostructures, utilizing the surface plasma resonance eﬀect,
have been adopted.
ZnO-based heterojunctions, in which ZnO couples with
another semiconductor8−10 or precious metal,11,12 have
received wide attention. In a semiconductor−semiconductor
heterojunction scheme, the photogenerated charges are
separated by the built-in electric ﬁeld, in which the

photogenerated holes ﬂow along the direction of the built-in
electric ﬁeld, while the photogenerated electrons migrate along
the opposite direction of the photogenerated holes. To
fabricate such an eﬀective inner electric ﬁeld to achieve a
high photocatalytic activity, the selection of the components of
the heterojunction is very important. The diﬀerence of the
work function (WF) between the coupled semiconductors
determines the magnitude and direction of the inner electric
ﬁeld. As a result, experimental investigation into the interface
properties of the coupled semiconductors, including the WF
measurement of each component, is of great importance. In
our previous studies, we have developed the Kelvin probe
system and investigated the photoelectric properties of Ag2O/
TiO2 heterojunctions. The good photocatalytic performance of
Ag2O/TiO2 was attributed to the large WF diﬀerence between
the Ag2O layer and the TiO2 layer.13
In the precious metal−semiconductor heterojunction
(Schottky junction) scheme, for a well-designed Schottky
junction, there is also an eﬀective inner electric ﬁeld near the
Schottky junction interface, promoting the separation of
photogenerated electrons and holes.11 More importantly,
precious metal nanomaterials can greatly enhance the photocatalytic performance of metal oxides due to their local surface
plasmon resonance eﬀect, which can extend the range of
optical absorption of the coupled metal oxide semiconductor.14
Deposition of noble metals such as Pt, Au, and Ag on the
surface of ZnO has become a key research hotspot because of
the eﬀective carrier separation and expansion of the bandwidth
of light absorption.15−17
Photocatalysts with nanoparticle morphology often have
excellent photocatalytic activity due to their large surface area.
However, the powder photocatalysts suﬀer from serious
aggregation, which distinctively reduces their eﬀective surface
area and restrains the photocatalytic activity. To overcome
these drawbacks, various types of low-dimensional ZnO
nanomaterials, such as nanorods,18 tubes,19 and ﬂowers,20
have been used as photocatalysts. Photocatalysts based on
ordered ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs), such as Ag/ZnO
nanorods/graphene21 and Ag/ZnO NRAs on Ni foam,22 which
have a high surface area and structural stability, displayed
excellent photocatalytic performance in many recent studies.
Substrates such as nylon,23 cotton,24 polyester,25 and soda-lime
glass,26 on which the nanorod arrays grow, can prevent the
nanorods from aggregation eﬀectively. In addition, by the
immobilization of photocatalysts on the substrates, it is easy for
photocatalysts to be separated or recycled from the processed
solution. Polyester fabrics (PFs) have many advantages such as
ﬂexibility, stable chemical properties, and low cost. As ﬂexible
synthetic materials, PFs have been used as substrates to grow
ZnO nanorod-based solar cells27 and for antibacterial coating.28 However, only few studies have reported that PFs acted
as substrates for preparation of photocatalysts such as ZnO
photocatalytic coating with ﬂake-like structure29 and Bi2WO6/
TiO2 nanorod array coating with self-cleaning function.30
There are no reports on Ag/ZnO NRA-modiﬁed PFs acting as
a highly active visible-light photocatalyst. The photocatalytic
mechanisms for Ag/ZnO NRA-based photocatalysts also need
more reliable experimental veriﬁcation.
In this work, we reported the successful preparation of ZnO
NRA on polyester fabric (PF) by a two-step process and the
modiﬁcation of ZnO NRA by a Ag layer deposited using
magnetron sputtering. The photocatalytic experiment results
indicate that the Ag/ZnO NRA-modiﬁed PF can degrade

Rhodamine B (RB) under visible light eﬃciently. Furthermore,
the mechanisms of the outstanding photocatalytic performance
of Ag/ZnO NRA-modiﬁed PF were investigated in detail using
the Kelvin probe system, surface photovoltage (SPV) test
system, Raman microspectroscopy, and UV−vis diﬀuse
reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS). The outstanding photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PFs was
attributed to the combined eﬀect of the inner electric ﬁeld of
the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction and Ag local surface
plasma resonance (LSPR).

2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
2.1. Synthesis of ZnO NRA- and Ag/ZnO NRA-Coated
PFs. The PFs made up of ∼50 μm thick ﬁbers were used as
substrates of the photocatalysts. All PF substrates were washed
ultrasonically with ethanol for 10 min to clear the impurities
from the surfaces of the ﬁbers. ZnO NRA-coated PFs (sample
1) were synthesized via a two-step process. Firstly, the ZnO
seed layer was deposited on polyester substrate via radio
frequency (RF) reactive magnetron sputtering with a Zn target
at room temperature. The sputtering pressure, sputtering
power, and Ar/O2 ratio were 0.6 Pa, 300 W, and 20:10,
respectively. The distance from the target to the polyester
substrate was set to 12 cm (the same below). The thickness of
the ZnO seed layer was ∼150 nm, which was monitored and
measured by a ﬁlm thickness controller (INFICON, SQC
310). In the second step, ZnO NRAs were grown on the
seeded polyester ﬁbers by a typical hydrothermal synthesis
method. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine
were added to deionized water under constant stirring to form
a water solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (100 mM/L) and
hexamethylenetetramine (100 mM/L), which was used to
grow ZnO NRA. Fifty milliliters of this solution was added to
150 mL of Teﬂon bottle with a polyester bracket on the
bottom. Then, the ZnO-seeded PF was dipped into the
solution and laid on the bracket with the ZnO-seeded side
facing down. The mixture was agitated at 95 °C for 4 h in a
laboratory oven to grow ZnO nanorods. After cooling down
naturally, the sample was taken out and washed in deionized
water several times and dried at 120 °C in the laboratory oven.
In order to synthesize Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PFs (sample 2),
the Ag layer was further deposited on ZnO NRA-coated PF via
RF magnetron sputtering with a Ag target at room temperature. The sputtering pressure and sputtering power were 0.6
Pa and 50 W, respectively. The thickness of the Ag ﬁlm was
∼100 nm. As a comparison, the PF with a 150 nm ZnO seed
layer was used as the control sample (sample 3).
2.2. Characterization of ZnO NRA- and Ag/ZnO NRACoated PFs. The surface morphologies of the ZnO NRA- and
Ag/ZnO NRA-coated polyester samples were investigated
using scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs
recorded on Hitachi S-4800. The crystal structures of ZnO
NRA and Ag/ZnO NRA were determined by the X-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) spectrum recorded on a Bruker Axs D 8
system. The chemical state of each element in the samples was
explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Simadzu
UV-2250). The optical absorbance and UV−vis diﬀuse
reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS) of ZnO NRA- and Ag/ZnO
NRA-coated polyester samples were analyzed by a Puxi
TU1901 spectrophotometer. The motions of the photogenerated charges were studied by surface photovoltage
(SPV, Stanford SR830) spectra and photoluminescence (PL,
Horiba, Dual UV-NIR) spectra. The self-made Kelvin probe

system was applied to measure the WFs of ZnO NRA and the
deposited Ag layer. Raman spectra of R6G on the samples were
measured using a confocal Raman microscope (Horiba
T64000).
2.3. Photocatalytic Experiments. In order to evaluate
the photocatalytic activities of ZnO NRA- and Ag/ZnO NRAcoated PFs, photocatalytic degradation of RB was performed
under visible light. For comparison, all samples were of the
same size, which was 45 mm in diameter. The test sample was
placed on the bottom of reactor and ﬁxed. 10 mL RB solution
with an initial concentration of 5 mg/L as simulated pollutants
was poured into the reactor. A 75 W metal halide lamp (Philips
940) coupled with a 420 nm UV cutoﬀ ﬁlter was applied as the
excitation light source. The optical power density can be
adjusted by changing the distance between the photocatalytic
reactor and the light source, which was set to 20 mW/cm2. The
absorbance ratio A/A0 of RB at the wavelength of 553 nm,
which was measured by a UV−vis spectrophotometer (Puxi
TU1901) for every 30 min, was selected to evaluate the
degradation of RB. The degradation level of RB and the value
of photocatalytic rate constant k can be calculated by

Figure 3. XRD diﬀraction spectra for pure PF, PF with ZnO seed
layer (sample 3), ZnO nanorod array-coated PF (sample 1), and Ag/
ZnO nanorod array-coated PF (sample 2).

X-ray diﬀraction pattern of PF with the ZnO seed layer shows
that the (002) peak of ZnO is located at ∼34.6°, which
illustrates that the seed deposited by RF reactive magnetron
sputtering was ZnO. In the XRD pattern of the Ag/ZnO NRAcoated PF, the peaks positioned at 39.4 and 43.1° can be
assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of Ag (JCPDS 040783).33
The chemical states of Ag and Zn were explored by
comparative XPS analysis of the ZnO NRA-coated sample and
the Ag/ZnO NRA-coated sample. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the
Ag 3d peaks only appeared in the XPS spectrum of the Ag/
ZnO NRA-coated sample. The high resolution spectra of the
Ag 3d peaks (Figure 4c) show that Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks
were located at 368.2 and 374.3 eV, respectively, which
illustrates the existence of Ag in the metallic state.34 The Zn 2p
spectra (Figure 4d) of sample 1 exhibit two peaks located at
1044.2 and 1021.1 eV, corresponding to the binding energies
of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, and implying a normal
state of Zn2+ in the ZnO NRA.35,36
The UV−vis DRS of the ZnO NRA-coated PF (sample 1)
and Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF (sample 2) are shown in Figure
5. Figure 5a shows that the wavelength range of the light
absorbed by the ZnO NRA-coated PF expands from the UV
region to visible region, indicating the occurrence of electron
transition in the ZnO nanorod between the conduction band
and surface states or surface defect states, and between the
valence band and surface states or surface defect states, under
visible-light irradiation. Both the ZnO NRA-coated PF and
Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF possess a sharp absorption edge at
about 400 nm. However, compared with the ZnO NRA-coated
PF, the Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF has increased absorption in
both visible and near-ultraviolet light regions, which demonstrates that the Ag layer deposited on ZnO NRA greatly
broadens the scope of optical absorption. We speculate that
the high absorbance of the Ag/ZnO NRA-composited ﬁlm can
be attributed to the surface plasma resonance of Ag-modiﬁed
ZnO NRA, which was further investigated by Raman spectra.
The band gap of ZnO NRA can be obtained by extrapolating
the rising linear part of the plot of [F(R)hν]2 versus photon
energy to the photon energy axis (the red dotted line in Figure
5b). The band gap of ZnO NRA is determined to be 3.19 eV,

where A0 is the initial absorbance of the RB solution and At is
the absorbance of the RB solution after photocatalytic
degradation for a time interval of t.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Composition and Structure. The optical images of
the original PF, ZnO NRA-coated PF, and Ag/ZnO NRAcoated PF are illustrated in Figure 1. ZnO NRA-coated PFs
(Figure 1b) show an oﬀ-white surface, which is a little diﬀerent
in surface color from that of the pure white original PF (Figure
1a). It is remarkable that the surface of the Ag-modiﬁed ZnO
NRA (Figure 1c) shows a dark brown color, which is
completely diﬀerent from the metallic luster of the Ag layer
deposited on the sites without ZnO NRA, such as the holding
trace left in the process of ZnO seed deposition. The
morphology of sample 1 observed by SEM shows that ZnO
NRA had grown on the surface of the polyester ﬁber, as shown
in Figure 2c,d. For comparison, the SEM image of the original
PF is also presented in Figure 2a,b. The average diameter of
the nanorods on sample 2, as shown in the SEM images, is a
little larger than that on sample 1, because a thin Ag ﬁlm was
deposited on the top of ZnO nanorod.
The XRD spectra of pure PF, PF with the ZnO seed layer,
ZnO NRA-coated PF, and Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF are
presented in Figure 3. The large characteristic diﬀraction peaks
of samples located between 20 and 40° are due to the
semicrystalline polyester ﬁbers.31 The broad diﬀraction peak at
54°, which appears in the X-ray diﬀraction pattern of each
sample, also derives from polyester ﬁbers. The sharp peaks of
ZnO NRA-coated PF conﬁrm that the ZnO NRA layer has
good crystallinity. The peaks are centered around 30.9, 34.6,
36.4, 47.4, and 62.8°, which correspond to the (100), (002),
(101), (102), and (103) crystal planes of ZnO (JCPDS 89−
0510), respectively.32 The strongest peak at 34.6° indicates
that the ZnO nanorods grew preferentially along [0001]. The

min) was also prominently better than that of the ZnO NRAcoated PF (82% elimination of RB after 120 min) under UV
light irradiation, which was similar to the situation under
visible-light irradiation.
The photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnO NRA samples
with diﬀerent thicknesses of the Ag layer under visible-light
irradiation were also examined. As shown in Figure 8c,d, Ag/
ZnO NRA samples with the 50 nm Ag layer and 100 nm Ag
layer exhibited lower photocatalytic activity than that with the
100 nm Ag layer. The photocatalytic activity of the sample
with the 50 nm Ag layer was very close to that of the sample
with the 100 nm Ag layer (sample 2), which indicated that the
optimum thickness of the Ag layer was ∼100 nm.
In order to study the inner electric ﬁeld and the transport of
photogenerated charges in the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction, the self-made Kelvin probe system, which has been
described in detail in the previous article,13 was employed to
measure the WFs of Ag and ZnO NRA. The ZnO NRA and
Ag/ZnO NRA were fabricated on an Al foil as the test sample
to measure the WFs of ZnO NRA and Ag. Figure 9a shows the
measured contact potential diﬀerence (CPD) of the Au/Ag
and Au/ZnO nanorod arrays, which are 0.430 and −0.456 V,
respectively. The WFs of ZnO NRA and Ag can be determined
by the following equation: Wsample = WAu probe − e·CPD, where
Wsample is the WF of the sample, WAu probe is the WF of the
probe, which is 5.10 eV for the Au probe, and e is the electron
charge. The calculated WFs of Ag and ZnO NRA are 4.67 and
5.56 eV, respectively (see Figure 9b). Thus, the EF diﬀerence
between Ag and ZnO NRA is 0.89 eV. When the ZnO
nanorod integrates with Ag, since the EF of Ag is higher than
that of the ZnO nanorod, electrons migrate from the Ag layer
to the ZnO nanorod, and holes transport from the ZnO
nanorod to the Ag layer, until the EF of the ZnO nanorod and
Ag are aligned. The transport of electrons and holes results in
an inner electric ﬁeld in the Ag/ZnO nanorod junction.
Consequently, the energy bands near the interface between Ag
and the ZnO nanorod bend. The direction of the inner electric
ﬁeld in the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction is from the top to
the inner of the ZnO nanorod. The inner electric ﬁeld exerts
forces on the photogenerated electron and hole in opposite
directions and promotes the separation of photogenerated
charges. Speciﬁcally, the photogenerated holes drift from the
Ag layer side to the inner of the ZnO nanorod and the
photogenerated electrons drift in the opposite direction.
According to the above results and the value of the
conduction band edge ECB of ZnO reported in the relevant
literature studies (the electron aﬃnity of ZnO is ∼4.50
eV),39,40 the energy band structure diagram of the Ag/ZnO
nanorod heterojunction can be obtained and used to illustrate
the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of Ag/ZnO NRA.
The band structures of ZnO NRA before combining with Ag
are shown in Figure 8b. The Fermi levels EF of Ag and ZnO
NRA were 4.67 and 5.56 eV below the vacuum level E0,
respectively. The Fermi level EF of ZnO NRA is closer to the
conduction band edge than the valence band edge, indicating
that the as-prepared ZnO NRA is an n-type semiconductor.
The band structure of the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction is
presented in Figure 9c, in which the direction of the inner
electric ﬁeld is indicated by a vector symbol.
The SPV spectra were further employed to study the

nanorod heterojunction. As is known, the SPV spectrum is
sensitive to the transfer and separation of photogenerated

NRA-coated PF has high SERS activities. The resolved Raman
peaks of R6G, which were located at around 626, 783, 1196,
1324, 1373, 1523, and 1662 cm−1, are in accordance with the
previously reported values.37,38 However, very weak Raman
signals were observed on the ZnO NRA-coated PF and pure
PF. Because there was no Ag layer on the surface of the ZnO
NRA-coated PF and pure PF, both samples cannot produce
the SERS eﬀect.
The visible-light photocatalytic performances of the asprepared ZnO NRA-coated PF and Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF
were evaluated by the photodegradation of RB solution (5 mg/
L) under visible light. The degradation curves have been
plotted using the absorbance values at 554 nm in the
absorbance curves. As shown in Figure 7d,e, even when
irradiated by light, the pure PF exhibits extremely weak ability
in the elimination of RB. The graphs in Figure 7c,e show that
the ZnO-seeded PF has a low photocatalytic activity (40%
elimination of RB after 120 min). The ZnO NRA-coated PF
shows a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance
(76% elimination of RB after 120 min), and the Ag/ZnO
NRA-coated PF shows the highest photocatalytic performance
(90% elimination of RB after 120 min). The pseudo-ﬁrst-order
kinetics of RB degradation are displayed in Figure 7f, in which
the ﬁrst-order kinetics model ln(A/A0) = −kt is used to ﬁt the
processes of photodegradation. As shown in Figure 7f, the
ZnO NRA-coated PF, Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF, and ZnOseeded PF have rate constants of 1.18 × 10−2, 1.85 × 10−2, and
2.87 × 10−3 min−1, respectively. The quantitative analysis
shows the higher photocatalytic activity of sample 2 than
sample 1 and sample 3, which implies an obviously enhanced
photocatalytic performance of the Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF.
In order to comprehensively compare the photocatalytic
activities of Ag/ZnO NRA and ZnO NRA, we also investigated
the photocatalytic performances of samples under UV light
(365 nm) with the same optical power density (20 mW/cm2).
The degradations of RB by the Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF and
ZnO NRA coated PF are presented in Figure 8a,b. Both Ag/
ZnO NRA-coated PF and ZnO NRA-coated PF showed better
photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation than under
visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of the

inset. An obvious response can be observed from 325 to 550
nm, corresponding to the wavelength range in which the
photogenerated charges were generated and separated. It is
notable that the SPV response range extends to 550 nm, which
is much larger than the absorbing edge of ZnO NRA (∼389
nm) as shown in Figure 5b. The SPV phase angles were in the
range between 140 and 180° corresponding to the wavelength
range between 325 and 550 nm, indicating that the
photogenerated electrons transported to the top of the ZnO

charges. For measuring the SPV signals of the Ag/ZnO
nanorod heterojunction, the sandwich structure was fabricated
by covering the Ag/ZnO NRA sample with an indium tin
oxide (ITO) conductive glass as the counter electrode. At each
end of the sample, a piece of insulating tape with the same
thickness of ∼100 μm was placed between the sample and the
counter electrode to avoid the eﬀect of the ITO ﬁlm. The
measured SPV magnitude spectrum and SPV phase spectrum
of the Ag/ZnO NRA sample are shown in Figure 10 and the

To investigate the eﬀect of the built-in electric ﬁeld in the
Ag/ZnO nanorod on the transport of photogenerated
electrons and holes, photoelectric current measurements
were carried out at a zero bias under UV light (365 nm)
irradiation. The carrier separation eﬃciency can be determined
by the intensity of the photoelectric current. The measured
photoelectric current spectra of the ZnO NRA sample and Ag/
ZnO NRA sample are shown in Figure 12. The Ag/ZnO NRA
sample has a photoelectric current of ∼0.2 mA/cm2, which is
∼3 times higher than that of the ZnO NRA sample. The high
photoelectric current can be attributed to the built-in electric
ﬁeld in the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction, which promotes
the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.
In order to identify the contribution of the active radicals,
radical and hole trapping experiments were carried out with
various radical scavengers in the photocatalytic degradation
process. Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
(Na2-EDTA), benzoquinone (BQ), and isopropyl alcohol
(IPA) were applied to scavenge h+, •O2−, and •OH,
respectively. Figure 13a shows the eﬀects of BQ, IPA, and
Na2-EDTA on the photocatalytic degradation of RB by the
Ag/ZnO NRA sample under visible light. The degradation

nanorod and the photogenerated holes migrated to the inner of
the ZnO nanorod, which generated a negative SPV response.41
Therefore, the direction of the inner electric ﬁeld should be
from the Ag layer to the inner of the ZnO nanorod, which is
consistent with the conclusion deduced from the measured WF
diﬀerence between Ag and the ZnO nanorod (Figure 9c).
Based on the measured CPD of each component and SPV
spectra, we can reach the conclusion that the photogenerated
holes and electrons were separated eﬃciently by the inner
electric ﬁeld in the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction. The Ag
layer deposited on the ZnO nanorod plays a critical role in
separating the photogenerated charges.
In order to conﬁrm the mechanisms of the photoinduced
charge carrier separation, we measured the PL spectra of Ag/
ZnO NRA and ZnO NRA samples. PL emission results from
the recombination of electron−hole pairs. The larger the
intensity of the PL spectra, the higher the electron−hole
recombination rate. As shown in Figure 11, Ag/ZnO NRA
exhibits a much lower intensity of PL spectra than ZnO NRA,
demonstrating that the electron−hole recombination in Ag/
ZnO nanorod was greatly suppressed by Ag modiﬁcation.

photodegradation process under the irradiation of visible light.
However, when Na2-EDTA and BQ were added as h+ and

revealed that the photodegradation of RB by Ag/ZnO NRA

4. CONCLUSIONS
ZnO NRA-coated PFs were prepared by a two-step process.
The as-prepared ZnO NRA was modiﬁed by Ag deposited
using magnetron sputtering. The photocatalytic performance
of the Ag/ZnO NRA-coated PF is signiﬁcantly higher than that
of the Ag-free ZnO NRA-coated PF. The measured WF
diﬀerence between Ag and ZnO NRA indicates the existence
of an inner electric ﬁeld in the Ag/ZnO nanorod
heterojunction and the direction of the ﬁeld is from the top
to the inner of the ZnO nanorod. The measured SPV spectra
demonstrate the eﬃcient separation of photogenerated holes
and electrons in the Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction, and
further conﬁrm the direction of the inner electric ﬁeld in the
Ag/ZnO nanorod heterojunction. The enhancement of light
absorption by LSPR eﬀect was observed by UV−vis diﬀuse
reﬂectance spectroscopy and Raman microspectroscopy. The
signiﬁcantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Ag/ZnO
NRA-coated PF under visible-light irradiation compared to the
Ag-free ZnO NRA-coated PF is attributed to the high
photogenerated charges separation eﬃciency and the enhanced
local surface plasma resonance. The as-prepared Ag/ZnO
NRA-modiﬁed PF can be a good candidate for practical
wastewater treatment.

Abstract: This research aimed to study the influence of lyocell with incorporated ZnO (CLY)
for antibacterial activity and biodegradation of fiber blends composed of viscose (CV), flax (LI),
and CLY. Fiber blended samples with an increased weight fraction of CLY fibers were composed,
and single CLY, CV and LI fibers were also used for comparison. Antibacterial activity was
determined for the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
The biodegradation of fiber blends was investigated by the soil burial test. The results show that
the single CLY fibers exhibited high antimicrobial activity against both E. coli and S. aureus bacteria
and that the presence of LI fibers in the blended samples did not significantly affect antibacterial
activity against E. coli, but drastically decreased the antibacterial activity against S. aureus. LI fibers
strongly promoted the growth of S. aureus and, consequently, impaired the antimicrobial performance
of ZnO against this bacterium. The presence of CLY fibers slowed down, but did not prevent, the
biodegradation process of the fiber blends, even at the highest ZnO concentration. The soil that was
in contact with the fiber blended samples during their burial was not contaminated to such an extent
as to affect the growth of sprouts, confirming the sustainability of the fiber blends.

1. Introduction
Antimicrobial activity is one of the most important functional properties of cellulose fibers
since these fibers are very easily attacked by both bacteria and fungi [1–4]. Excessive growth of
microorganisms on the fibers can cause health and hygiene problems for the textile wearer, on the
one hand, as well as lower the value of the textile product when in use, on the other [2]. However,
when fabricating antimicrobial cellulose fibers, a greater risk appears to be that the incorporation
of an antimicrobial agent may destroy the fiber’s biodegradability, which represents a prominent
characteristic and significant advantage of cellulose fibers from an ecological point of view. Namely,
cellulose fibers are known as environmentally-friendly fibers because they are readily degraded by
soil microorganisms [5]. Therefore, the creation of antimicrobial activity while maintaining the fiber’s
biodegradability remains a major challenge, which requires the careful selection of an antimicrobial
agent and its concentration.
Among antimicrobial agents, ZnO has attracted a lot of attention due to the general perception
that it is a safe, environmentally friendly, and biocompatible substance [6–8]. The antimicrobial activity

of ZnO is directly related to its photocatalytic performance under UV irradiation, in which reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are generated [9–13]. It is assumed that the generation of H2 O2 and •OH, in
particular, is crucial for the efficiency of ZnO as an antimicrobial agent. In addition to ROS, Zn2+ cations
released from ZnO dissolution as well as ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) contribute to the antimicrobial
activity. It is believed that ROS can easily incorporate into the bacterial cell membrane, causing the
disruption of cellular components via oxidative stress. Zn2+ cations can penetrate the bacterial cell,
where they inhibit its action. If ZnO is present in the form of NPs, the direct contact of ZnO NPs with
the bacterial cell wall results in the destruction of cell integrity. Accordingly, the mechanism of the
antimicrobial activity of ZnO is strongly influenced by ZnO particle size and crystal structure as well
as the environmental conditions. It is worth noting that under dark conditions, which apply for the
biodegradation process, the antimicrobial activity of ZnO is assumed to be mainly attributed to Zn2+
cations and ZnO NPs and less related to ROS, since the generation of these species is conditioned by
UV irradiation [13].
Our research aims to investigate the influence of ZnO on the antibacterial activity of cellulose
fibers as well as their biodegradation. For this purpose, lyocell with incorporated ZnO (CLY), viscose
(CV), and flax (LI) fibers were used and the concentration of the ZnO was varied with the concentration
of the CLY in the fiber blend. To increase the concentration of ZnO in the samples, the proportion of
CLY fibers was increased by decreasing the proportion of CV at a constant content of LI in the blends.
The reason for using these fiber blends was that CV/LI blends are very popular in the manufacturing of
summer clothing, for which antimicrobial protection is of great importance. The antibacterial activity
of samples was estimated against Escherichia coli as the Gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus as the
Gram-positive bacterium. An important goal of our research was also to determine the influence of LI
fibers on the antimicrobial properties of fiber blends. Namely, according to the literature [14–16], LI
fibers have a reputation for being intrinsically antibacterial. The biodegradation of the samples was
estimated by the soil burial test. It was hypothesized that the antimicrobial activity of ZnO in the soil
would be impaired, which would beneficially affect the biodegradation process of the fiber blends.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
Three types of cellulose fibers were used, i.e., antimicrobial lyocell with incorporated ZnO (CLY,
Smart Fiber AG, Rudolstadt, Germany), viscose (CV, Lenzing, Austria), and flax (LI, Liniere de
Saint Martin, France). In CLY production, 16% of ZnO was embedded into the fibers by the solvent
spinning technique.
For the antibacterial tests, seven samples of three-component CLY/CV/LI fiber blends with a
mass of 1.0 ± 0.1 g were prepared with an increased weight fraction of CLY fibers (0%, 15%, 20%,
25%, 30%, 55%, and 70%) along with the appropriate decrease in the weight fraction of CV fibers and
a constant amount of LI fibers (30%). Furthermore, one sample was prepared of a two-component
fiber blend composed of CLY and CV. The samples were prepared by weighing the individual fibers
and assembling them into blends. Single CLY, CV, and LI fiber samples of the same mass were also
prepared for the investigation. The sample codes and their compositions are summarized in Table 1.
For the soil burial test, five samples named K (control), CLY(25), CLY(70), CLY(100), CV(100),
and LI(100) were selected. The mass of the samples was 15.0 ± 0.1 g. The samples were prepared
by weighing the individual fibers and mixing them together with a stirrer (Shirley trash analyzer,
Ikon Industries, India) to achieve a homogeneous mixture. The nonwoven fabric samples were put
into models with dimensions of 24 cm × 21 cm and clamped between wooden plates with the help
of clamps. After 7 days, the clamps were removed, and the compressed samples were wrapped in
plastic net.

2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy
The amount of ZnO in the CLY(100) sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma
mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) using a Perkin Elmer SCIED Elan DRC spectrophotometer. A sample of
0.5 g was prepared in the Milestone microwave system using acid decomposition with 60% nitric acid
and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Three measurements were carried out, and the ZnO concentrations are
reported as the mean values and standard deviation (SD).
2.2.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a JEOL JSM 6060 LV SEM instrument
operating with a primary electron beam of 10 kV accelerating voltage and a working distance of
17 mm. The samples were coated with a thin layer of gold before observation to increase the clarity of
the images. SEM analysis was also performed using an SEM Ultra+ microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) X-Max 50 (Oxford, UK).
The samples were coated with a thin layer of platinum before observation. Sample inspection was
carried out with a low acceleration primary electron beam (1 kV at 40 pA) with the detection of
secondary electrons.
2.2.3. Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Spectrum GX I spectrophotometer
(Perkin Elmer, Great Britain) equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) cell and a diamond
crystal (n = 2.0). The spectra were recorded over a range of 4000 to 600 cm−1 using 32 scans at a
resolution of 4 cm−1 .
2.2.4. Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial activity of samples was estimated for the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli
ATCC 11229 and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 according to the
ASTM E 2149–01 standard method [17]. A fabric sample of 1 g was immersed in 50 mL of an NB
(nutrient broth, Oxoid, CM0067, Basingstoke, UK) medium of known bacterial concentration in a flask,
which was then shaken using a wrist-action shaker. To provide efficient leaching of ZnO from the CLY
fibers into the NB culture, 2 h of contact time was selected. Afterwards, viable bacteria were quantified
with plate count method using NA (nutrient agar, Biolife, 4018102, Milano, Italy) and incubation of NA
plates at 37 ◦ C for 24 h. Two parallel assessments were performed for each fabric sample. The number
of colonies was counted, and if the duplicate counts of any sample did not agree within 15%, we

Materials 2019, 12, 3399

discarded that sample and repeated the test. Afterwards, the number of colonies was converted to
the number of bacteria as colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL). The reduction in the number of
bacteria, R, was calculated as follows:
R=

(B − A)
× 100 (%)
B

(1)

where R is the bacterial reduction, A is the number of bacteria in a flask containing a sample with
incorporated antimicrobial CLY fibers after 2 h of contact time, and B is the number of bacteria in a
flask containing a reference sample without antimicrobial CLY fibers after 2 h of contact time. The R
value is reported as the mean value and standard error.
To determine the number of viable bacterial cells in the NB medium before and after the specified
contact time, the number of bacteria at “0” contact time and after 2 and 24 h of contact with fibers was
determined. To determine the number of adhered bacteria, the flasks containing the fibers in contact
for 24 h were previously treated in the Sonis 10GT ultrasonic apparatus (Iskra PIO d.o.o., Slovenia)
for 10 min (30 kHz, 1100 W) [18]. For comparison, the number of bacteria in the flask containing the
inoculum only was determined after the specified contact time.
2.2.5. Soil Burial Test
The soil burial test was carried out in accordance with the ISO 11721-1:2001 and ISO 11721:2003
standards [19,20]. Following this standard procedure, the container was filled with commercial grade
compost. The water content of the soil was 60 ± 5% of its maximum moisture retention capacity.
This was held constant during the experiment by spraying with water. The pH of the soil was between
4.0 and 7.5. Fabric samples were buried in the soil for periods of 10, 20, 30, and 50 days. After the
defined incubation time, the samples were removed from the test soil, rinsed with running tap water
and immersed in 70% ethanol for 30 min before air drying.
2.2.6. Soil Contamination
To investigate the potential impact of buried samples on the soil contamination, soil that was in
direct contact with samples K, CLY(25), and CLY(70) during 50 days of burial was transferred into
plastic pots. Soil that was not in contact with the fabric samples was used as a reference. Fifty seeds
of Sinapis arvensis were planted into each pot, and the sprouts were counted after 14 days of growth.
Four parallel assessments were performed for each sample, and the mean value and standard deviation
were determined. The influence of soil on sprout growth was determined by analysis of variance
(ANOVA, F test, 1% level of probability).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of CLY Fibers
The SEM images of CLY fibers in Figure 1a,b show the surface morphological properties as well
as the distribution of ZnO particles incorporated into the fibers. It was observed that ZnO particles
of irregular shapes and particle sizes ranging from 70 to 800 nm were evenly distributed on the CLY
fibers. The EDS spectrum (Figure 1c) clearly revealed a characteristic peak at 1.03 keV, which was
attributed to Zn.
According to the ICP-MS analysis, the concentration of ZnO in the CLY(100) sample was
120 ± 1 mg/g.

was accompanied by high adhesion of S. aureus onto the LI fibers and the formation of a biofilm.
The presence of ZnO slowed down the biodegradation process of the fiber blends compared to
the sample that did not include CLY fibers, but ZnO did not eliminate the fibers’ biodegradation,
even at the highest concentration. This was confirmed by the increased intensity of the absorption
bands belonging to the amides I and II groups of secondary polyamides due to the protein portion,
indicating the microbial growth on the fibers. Furthermore, the rotting of fiber blends and the leaching
of ZnO from the samples during soil burial did not significantly contaminate the soil, proving the
sustainability of the fiber blends.

Covering the natural ﬁbers with metal oxides enhances the antibacterial properties of textiles. The eﬃciency of
the nanostructured layer is determined by its thickness, uniformity, conﬁguration and adherence to the ﬂexible
substrate. Conformal coatings with ZnO and Al2O3 of cotton and viscose fabrics were achieved by Atomic Layer
Deposition (ALD) at low temperature. Morphological examination conducted by Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) displayed the surface functionalization, elemental mapping provided by Energy Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy (EDS) illustrated the uniform distribution of Zn and Al oxides, and the chemical structure stability
was demonstrated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR). The inhibition of Escherichia coli and
Staphylococcus aureus evaluated after 18 h of incubation disclosed very good antibacterial properties of the organic-inorganic composites, with emphasis on viscose coated with metal oxides. In vitro cytotoxic studies developed through direct and indirect contact methods, highlighted the non-toxic eﬀects of Al2O3 on human ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes.

1. Introduction
Cellulose-based cotton is the most widely used natural fabric and
viscose is the ﬁrst artiﬁcial ﬁber available [1,2]. Surface modiﬁcation of
fabrics with materials exhibiting antibacterial properties received
during the last decade signiﬁcant interest in health and biomedical
applications [3–8]. Employed as surgical threads, wound dressings,
bandages, surgical masks, gowns and apparel, cotton and viscose require constant antibacterial enhancement, in the attempt of controlling
the risk of infection and cross-contamination [7–10]. Organic antibacterial agents were considered [10–12], but the inorganic oxides
oﬀer greater stability and varied conﬁgurations [12,13]. Metal oxides
like CuO [14,15], MgO [16,17], ZnO [17–20], Ag2O [19,21], TiO2
[20,22,23], Al2O3 [23,24] were studied for their antibacterial and antifungal properties, with strong activity exhibited in form of nanoparticles [13,16,22,24], nanostructures [6,11,22,25,26] or nanolayers

[14,18,27]. Surface modiﬁcation of cellulosic materials with metal
oxides has been demonstrated to be excellent inhibitors of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [18,22,23,28–30]. Depending on their
mechanism of action, the metal oxides can be classiﬁed into the ones
that involve oxidation (ZnO, TiO2, Ag2O, CuO) and those that inhibit
the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) (Al2O3, MgO)
[14,16,23].
Thin layers of metal oxides are applied in present technologies to
control physical and mechanical properties, the surface reactivity or
wettability [18,22,31]. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a vapourphase technique developed in the 1970s to produce various thin ﬁlms
by exposing a substrate to gaseous chemical precursors, in alternative,
separated doses [32–34]. With each cycle, an atomic layer of the material of interest is added and the process can be repeated until the
desired thickness is reached. The method is suitable for uniform coating
of surfaces with complex morphologies, nanopores, nanotubes or

nanowires [35–37] and has shown great potential in upcoming energy
conversion and semiconductor technologies [33,38–41]. Thin ﬁlms of
ZnO [38–45] and Al2O3 [46–50] deposited by ALD at low temperature
have attracted interest for a wide range of applications in micro- and
optoelectronics, such as sensors, electronic devices, transparent electronics, UV light emitters, solar cells, and so on.
ZnO has also been grown by ALD at low temperatures on natural
ﬁbers [41]. Temperature dependent deposition protocols for SiO2/
Al2O3 multilayers were developed on nanocellulose ﬁlms, with applications in bio-based nanocomposites, diagnostics and responsive
membranes [51]. ALD has also been considered for developing inorganic coatings on cellulose-based ﬁbrous materials [31,41,51–53],
and proved to be suitable for modifying the vulnerable organic substrates without altering their morphology, by applying low temperatures in the reactions [45,50,53,54].
Vähä-Nissi et al. [54] studied the antibacterial properties of ZnO
and Al2O3 deposited by ALD at low-temperature on oriented polylactic
acid and polypropylene ﬁlms. By direct contact between the bacteria
and the thin oxide ﬁlms, the composites shown antibacterial activity
against E. coli. Ansari et al. [24] shown that a combination of ZnO and
Al2O3 ﬁlms (nanolaminates) can be used to modulate the antibacterial
activity.
Various ZnO particle morphologies (in size and shape) were demonstrated to exhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria inhibition. Aqueous suspensions of ZnO may induce increased levels of
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), contributing to their antibacterial activity [13,55]. ALD ZnO was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity
against S. aureus under UV-A light, as a result of photo-generated reactive oxygen species [55]. Cytotoxicity studies of keratinocytes in
contact with nanoporous alumina membranes coated with ZnO by ALD
indicated that the cells were not aﬀected, but in fact the keratinocytes
exhibited higher viability in contact with coated membranes [56].
Other studies [57–60] have shown ZnO to be among the most toxic
nanoparticles, related to the generation of reactive oxygen species; as a
consequence, they caused inhibition of cell proliferation, plasma
membrane damage, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death
[59–61].
Ansari et al. [62], demonstrated the antibacterial properties of
Al2O3 nanoparticles on antibiotic-resistant E. coli colonies, regardless of
their drug-resistance mechanisms; the binding of Al2O3 onto the bacterial cell wall caused damage and their subsequent penetration resulted in the inhibition of cell growth. However, the exact interaction of
Al2O3 with bacteria and the permeation of the nanoparticles into the
cells remain to be elucidated [24]. ALD Al2O3 thin ﬁlm deposited on
polylactic acid and polypropylene has shown lower growth inhibition
on E. coli when compared to ALD ZnO [54]. The cytotoxicity assays
using Al2O3 indicated to have the least impact onto normal human lung
cells (L-132) and lung cancer cells (A549) [58]. Low cytotoxic eﬀects
can be explained by the role of Al2O3 as radical scavenger, able to block
the generation of ROS [23,57]. In fact, in vitro assays have demonstrated cytocompatibility of amorphous alumina [63].
Organic-inorganic composites showing 60–75% growth inhibition
of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were developed by covering cellulose-based ﬁbers with thin layers of metal oxides by low
temperature ALD technique. Conformal coatings with ZnO and Al2O3
on cotton and viscose were largely well tolerated by the human ﬁbroblast and keratinocyte cells involved in the cytotoxicity studies.

ozone treatment.
Cotton (C) and Viscose (V) samples were prepared for ALD coating
with ZnO and Al2O3. Control samples (C0 and V0, respectively) were
retained for comparison with the metal oxides-coated ones. Red colour
was used to depict the ZnO-coated cotton and viscose samples according to the number of ALD cycles (C-150ZnO, C-300ZnO and V150ZnO, V-300ZnO respectively), and blue for the Al2O3-coated ones
(C-150Al2O3, C-300Al2O3 and V-150Al2O3, V-300Al2O3), as mentioned
in Table 1.
Aiming to approximate the deposition rate and the oxide layers
thickness, additional Si wafer fragments were considered for ALD
coating together with the dedicated fabrics. The deposition rate is expected to be slightly diﬀerent on the ﬂexible textile substrates for the
ﬁrst tens of ALD cycles due to the absorbent nature of the materials.
In order to enhance the wettability and surface free energy [65,66],
prior to the ALD process, all the textile and silicon samples were subjected to surface treatment by exposure to UV-ozone for 15 min at 50 °C,
using the PSD Pro UV-Ozone cleaner (Novascan Technologies, USA).
Diethylzinc (DEZ, 99.9998%-Zn, Puratrem, USA) was used as metal
organic precursor for the growth of ZnO on textile samples, and the
Al2O3 thin ﬁlms were developed by using Trimethylaluminum, (TMA,
99.999+%-Al, Puratrem, USA). Ultra-pure water was employed as the
oxidant agent and ultra-high purity nitrogen (Nitrogen 6.0, 99.9999 vol
%) was used as purging gas.
Each ZnO deposition cycle consisted in (І) 0.05 s dose of DEZ, (ІІ) 2 s
nitrogen purge, (Ш) 0.02 s dose of water and (IV) 5 s purge. For Al2O3,
the ALD cycles consisted in (I) 0.02 s dose of TMA, (II) 1.5 s nitrogen
purge, (III) 0.02 s dose of water and (IV) another 4 s purge.
No carrier gas was required, because the adequate vapour pressure
was achieved by combining the liquid precursors with water. The base
pressure of the ALD reactor was less than 10 × 10−3 Torr, and the typical operating pressure was maintained in the range of 0.2–0.5 Torr
[33,34,39].
150 and 300 ALD cycles were applied on ﬂexible textile substrates
and solid Si test fragments at 120 °C, with an estimated deposition rate
of 1.75 Å/ALD cycle for ZnO, and 0.9 Å/ALD cycle for Al2O3 (please see
Fig. S1 from Supporting information).
2.2. Morphological examination
Dedicated raw and coated cotton and viscose fabrics were covered
with 7 nm of gold by sputtering, employing the AUTO 500 system (BOC
Edwards, UK), in order to improve the surface conductivity and stability
of the ﬁbers under electron beam exposure in high vacuum conditions.
The morphological study of cellulose-based ﬁbers and measurements of the ZnO- and Al2O3-coated Si control fragments were performed with a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM),
NOVA NanoSEM 630 (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, USA) at low accelerating voltage (5–10 kV).
In order to measure the metal oxides layers and to evaluate the
reliability of the coating technique, the test Si fragments introduced
into the ALD chamber together with the textiles were also examined in
cross-section by SEM, in high resolution (please see Fig. S2 from
Supporting information).
Additional contact angle experiments were performed at room

2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Atomic Layer Deposition of ZnO and Al2O3 on cotton and viscose
The thermal deposition of thin layers of metal oxides was achieved
with an Atomic Layer Deposition system (OpAL, Oxford Instruments
Plasma Technology, UK), by applying harmless low temperature conditions onto cellulose-based substrates [50,54,64], after conducting an

considered statistically signiﬁcant.

temperature to assess the surface modiﬁcation in terms of wettability,
by employing KSV Theta optical tensiometer (Biolin Scientiﬁc,
Finland), and the deionized water droplet volume was controlled by the
dispensing system. Considering the high degree of absorption of raw
cellulosic textiles [31,52], the ﬁrst second of droplet coming into contact with the fabrics covered with ZnO and Al2O3 was recorded in fast
mode (60 frames/s), in order to observe the dispersion mechanism of
the deionized water, followed by 10 s (1 frame/s) of normal acquisition
mode. The data acquired from measurements carried out in triplicate
were displayed in Fig. S3 from Supporting information.

2.5. Cytotoxicity
For cytotoxicity experiments, uncoated and coated cotton and viscose samples were cut into 0.4 mm discs in order to ﬁt into the microtiter plates and were ﬁrst decontaminated using a Jouan MSC 12 UV
lamp (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) under laminar ﬂow. For statistical
relevance, 6 replicates/sample type were used for testing.
HS-27 ﬁbroblast cell line was provided by European Collection of
Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC, catalogue number 94041901,
USA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
antibiotic/antifungal. A human keratinocyte standardized cell line
(HaCaT) was supplied by Cell Lines Service (CLS, catalogue number
300493, Germany). The cells were cultured in complete DMEM media
containing 1.35 g/L glucose supplement, 1% antibiotic/antifungal and
10% FBS.
The cytotoxic eﬀect of cotton and viscose coated with ZnO and
Al2O3 was evaluated by establishing the correlation between the decrease of cell viability (MTS test) and the increase of enzymatic activity
in culture media (Lactate Dehydrogenase – LDH test) [69].
The cell treatment with 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTS) allowed the evaluation of oxidative metabolism and the response of a cell population to external factors
which can have a positive or negative impact on cell viability in culture.
For this reason, MTS test is used in cell proliferation and viability studies.
Cytotoxicity was evaluated by testing the activity of LDH using
spectrophotometry (Tristar LB 941, Berthold Technologies, Germany)
by monitoring the oxidation of NADH in the presence of pyruvate at
340 nm.
24 h cell adhesion has been performed and was subjected to the
active substance for 48 h. 7000 cells/well were employed, according to
the protocol speciﬁc for MTS/LDH test [70,71]. Two experimental
models were considered: i) direct contact of HS-27 and HaCaT cells
adhered for 24 h with the textile fabric coated with ZnO or Al2O3 and ii)
indirect contact with the cells adhered for 24 h and incubated for 48 h
with culture media in which the textile material was prior immersed for
96 h, in order to highlight the cytotoxic eﬀects of the oxides desorbed in
liquid.

2.3. Structural analysis
In order to assess the chemical composition of the modiﬁed textiles,
correlative elemental and structural analyses were attended.
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) was performed with an
EDAX Element Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) (EDAX Ametek, USA), to
depict the speciﬁc elemental composition and distribution. Using low
SEM magniﬁcation (3000×), low accelerating voltage (10 kV), a beam
current of 1.3 nA, and a 5 mm working distance, elemental mapping of
representative areas was performed at 130 eV resolution and 7.68 μs
ampliﬁcation time.
A Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker Optics, USA) was employed to
study the bond conﬁgurations of cotton, viscose and their composites
with ZnO and Al2O3 by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The investigated samples were placed on an ATR (Attentuated
Total Reﬂectance) platinum holder. The spectra were collected in a
wavenumber interval of 4000–400 cm−1 by averaging 64 scans and
with a resolution of 4 cm−1.
2.4. Antibacterial evaluation
The samples selected for antibacterial evaluation were ﬁrstly sterilized with a Vilber Lourmat Germicidal Lamp 2x30W-S (Witec AG,
Czech Republic), 5 min for each side, at 254 nm.
Escherichia coli (ATCC 8738) - Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic
bacterium, and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) - Gram-positive
bacterium were involved in our study.
The bacterial strains were cultured in tubes containing Luria Bertani
(LB) media as reported by Ansari et.al [67] at 37 °C (L.B. medium
composition: peptone, 10 g/L; yeast extract 5 g/L, NaCl 5 g/L).
The antibacterial activities of the samples were determined by calculating the percentage inhibition of growth using the formula proposed by Jaiswal et al. [68]:

I% = [(B18 − B0) − (C18 − C0)]/(B18 − B0)·100

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Morphological analysis of textiles coated with metal oxides by ALD

(1)

In order to evaluate the uniformity of metal oxides coating on cellulose-based ﬁbers, Au-coated dedicated samples were investigated by
SEM, as displayed in Figs. 1 and 2.
The low density of cotton woven depicted in Fig. 1(a) makes it
diﬃcult to uniformly cover the thick ﬁbers with metal oxides. No obvious morphological changes are shown after applying 150 ALD cycles
of ZnO (Fig. 1(b)) or Al2O3 (Fig. 1(d)), while the thicker oxide layers
developed after doubling the deposition cycles are clearly deﬁned by
the speciﬁc texture displayed in the 1 μm micrographs in Fig. 1(c) and
(e).
More compact viscose textile (Fig. 2(a)) oﬀers better support for
eﬃcient coating. The SEM images in Fig. 2(b)–(e) of coated viscose
samples disclose the formation of uniform oxide layers wrapping the
ﬁbers. The narrow spaces between the much thinner viscose strands are
ﬁlled up by the deposited oxides, providing greater stability for the
following antibacterial experiments.
Morphological characterization reveals that low temperature ALD
technique does not alter the base materials, because the shape and
texture of the ﬁbers are intact after ZnO and Al2O3 coating. The metal
oxides coatings developed after 300 ALD cycles show the obstruction of

where I is the percentage inhibition of growth, B18 is the blank compensated optical density at 600 nm, B0 is the blank-compensated OD600
of the positive control of the organism at 0 h, C18 is the negative control-compensated OD600 of the organism in the presence of test sample
at 18 h and C0 is the negative control-compensated OD600 of the organism in the presence of test sample at 0 h.
Sterile samples were incubated 18 h in test tubes containing 5 mL
microorganism culture. The sterile medium was inoculated with the
tested microorganism (1%). Once obtained 5 mL of culture were placed
over the samples. Optical density was determined after 18 h of incubation. Incubation was performed in the incubator Laboshake
Gerhardt.
The microbial growth was determined by measuring optical density
for the samples and control (bacteria culture without sample) at 600 nm
using Jenway 6715 UV-VIS Scanning Spectrophotometer with Single
Cell holder (Jenway, UK).
All data were expressed as mean standard deviations of the experiments carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed
with Origin 8.5. Student's t-test was used to determine the signiﬁcant
diﬀerences among the groups, and p-values less than 0.05 were

the investigated areas and displayed in Fig. 3.
EDX elemental mapping of the metal oxides coatings on cotton and
viscose revealed the uniform growth of ZnO and Al2O3 on the cellulosic
ﬁbers, with concentrations varying in respect to the superﬁcial layers
measured on the silicon fragments (Fig. S2). Thus, close values were
obtained on cotton and viscose for 150 and 300 ALD cycles. Less than
10% Zn and around 5% Al were obtained after 150 ALD cycles
(Fig. 3(a) and (c), respectively (e) and (g)), 32–34% Zn and 11–12% Al
were achieved after 300 cycles (Fig. 3(b) and (d), respectively (f) and
(h)).
Fig. 4 shows the comparative spectra extracted for the cotton and

textiles' micropores and the coating conﬁguration itself, noticeable in
the appropriate micrographs: for cotton and Fig. 2(c) and (e) for viscose, respectively.
Additionally, ZnO and Al2O3 ﬁlms were grown on planar silicon
substrates in the same conditions and SEM cross-section images are
presented in Fig. S2 from Supporting information.

viscose reference samples.
From a structural point of view, cotton and viscose can be described
by the formula of cellulose. The similarities can be observed from the
two ATR-FTIR spectra characterized mainly by the peaks which can be
assigned to the vibration modes of OeH, CeH and CeO bonds.
According to Carrillo et al. [72] and Pumure et al. [73], the following assignments of spectral bands of cellulose samples can be considered:
- for cotton - 3332 cm−1 ν(OeH), 2893 cm−1 νs(CeH), 1633 cm−1

Furthermore, the ability to extract the cellulose spectra from the
FTIR results of the composites is a strong suggestion of the oxides inclusion among the cellulose ﬁbers, which supports the wettability decrease demonstrated by the contact angle measurements (Fig. S3).
Except for the diﬀerences in the thickness of metal oxides associated
with the intensity variation of the peaks, the inorganic insertion between the cellulose ﬁbers explains the almost consistent degree of hydrophobicity for all types of samples.
3.3. Antibacterial eﬃciency
Microorganisms are capable of thriving into the structure of cellulosic ﬁbers due to their large active area, ability to retain moisture and
nutrients for the development of bioﬁlms [10]. The antibacterial activities of ZnO and Al2O3 ﬁlms on textiles were investigated against
gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus
aureus) bacteria by calculating the percentage inhibition of growth
using the formula (1);
The microorganisms used in this study were selected because of
their clinical signiﬁcance: Staphylococcus aureus causes infections ranging from relatively minor superﬁcial skin infections to severe conditions such as bacteraemia [76,77], while Escherichia coli is one of the
most frequent causes of many common bacterial infections, including
bacteremia, urinary tract infection, traveler's diarrhea, and pneumonia
[78,79].
The experiments performed in vitro demonstrated the eﬀectiveness
of the composites in inhibiting the growth of tested microorganism
(Fig. 7).
Fig. 7(a) shows close percentages of bacterial growth inhibition on
the same cellulosic substrate, regardless of the ZnO ﬁlm thicknesses.
The antibacterial capabilities of viscose-ZnO samples are 10–15%
higher than cotton-ZnO, with insigniﬁcant variations given by the deposition rates. This ﬁnding can be correlated with the observations of
Zhu et al. [36], which tested the antibacterial eﬃcacy of three ZnO
ﬁlms obtained by 30, 100 and 300 ALD cycles. Slight improvements
were observed after 30 ALD cycles, but impressive results were reported
for 100 and 300 ALD cycles, with small variations between them. In
Fig. 7(b), similar trends of inhibition rates are disclosed for cotton and
viscose samples covered with Al2O3, with ~10% superior values delivered by viscose. As previously suggested by ZnO, the antibacterial

the cellulose substrate and the oxide, thus conﬁrming that the cellulosic
structure of the substrate was not aﬀected (Fig. 5).
The variations of peaks that can be assigned to the stretching vibration mode of the ZneO bonds are able to provide information about
composites with the same base material by the thickness of the superﬁcial layer. Hence, by increasing the number of cycles, a proportional
increase in the absorption peak intensities can be identiﬁed. The
characteristic peaks of ZneO bonds can be seen at 405 cm−1 for C150ZnO, 411 cm−1 for C-300ZnO - Fig. 5(a) - and 558, 414 cm−1 for
V-150ZnO, as well as 553 and 414 cm−1 for V-300ZnO - Fig. 5(b) [74].
For the fabrics covered with Al2O3 (Fig. 6), no changes of the
spectra corresponding to the references were observed, certifying the
structural stability of the cellulosic substrate after ALD low temperature
treatment, displayed by the previous SEM morphological examination.
This observation allowed the base spectra of cotton and viscose to be
subtracted from the composites, in order to highlight the vibration
modes assigned to Al2O3.
Following the removal of the characteristic peaks of C0 and V0, we
have emphasized the peaks that can be attributed to the vibration mode
of the AleO bonds at: 734, 610, 563, 513 cm−1 for C-150Al2O3, 734,

eﬃcacy is not necessarily correlated with the number of Al2O3 deposition cycles employed in our study.
ZnO and Al2O3 act diﬀerently as antibacterial agents, but have almost the same outcome. Zn ﬁrst attaches on the surface of gram negative and gram positive bacteria, inﬂicting damage to the cell wall
[80]. Moreover, ZnO is capable of producing an increased amount of
ROS [55,81–83]. Al2O3 in form of nanoparticles attach ﬁrst to the
bacterial cell wall, leading to its breakage, cell damage and ﬁnally, lysis
[24,62]. The eﬀect of metallic oxides is combined with their capability
of increasing the hydrophobicity of the textiles [83]. It is known that
viscose has the capability to adsorb up to four times more bacteria than
cotton, due to its ability to retain more moisture [1]. An increased
surface hydrophobicity prevents the bacterial adhesion (antibiofouling
properties) [83,84].
In conclusion, the tests of antimicrobial properties against two typical bacteria indicate that thin layers of ZnO and Al2O3 grown at low
temperature display good antimicrobial properties. The cytotoxicity
assay will reveal the most appropriate metal oxide coating to be used in
healthcare applications.

The following materials were tested:
- uncoated cotton (C0), cotton coated with ZnO at 150 cycles (C150ZnO), cotton coated with ZnO at 300 cycles (C-300ZnO), cotton
coated with Al2O3 at 150 cycles (C-150 Al2O3) and cotton coated
with Al2O3 at 300 cycles (C-300 Al2O3).
- uncoated viscose (V0), viscose coated with ZnO at 150 cycles (V150ZnO), viscose coated with ZnO at 300 cycles (V-300ZnO), viscose coated with Al2O3 at 150 cycles (V-150 Al2O3) and viscose
coated with Al2O3 at 300 cycles (V-300 Al2O3).
Two parameters were tracked: MTS reduction (marker of cell viability) and extracellular release of LDH (marker for membrane disintegration).
The cytotoxic eﬀects of textile samples coated with ZnO and Al2O3
were assessed by MTS colorimetric assay and completed by LDH test.
The MTS assay is based on the mitochondrial dehydrogenases' involvement in the reduction of a tetrazolium compound into a coloured

eﬀects.
The cytotoxicity analyses by indirect contact of the keratynocites
and ﬁbroblasts with the tested materials display similar toxicity proﬁles
as previously exhibited by direct contact method, which indicate the
desorbtion of oxides from the substrate [90,91].
It is known that ZnO falls in the class of metal oxides that aﬀect cells
by generating ROS, whereas Al2O3 does not cause oxidative stress
[14,16,23]. ZnO is capable to inﬂict damage to the cell by conversion
into Zn2+ which accumulates in mitochondria. The excess Zn2+ causes
structural damage to mitochondria, collapse of the membrane potential,
and acts as a respiratory chain inhibitor by accumulation of free radical
oxygen species [58–61].
In our case, the textile coated with ZnO decrease the cell viability
but do not aﬀect the cell membrane's integrity. This indicates that only
a small quantity of ZnO from the superﬁcial layer may dissociate and
enter the cell, causing this behaviour.

formazan product, reﬂecting the enzymatic activity of the living cells
[85,86]. The LDH colorimetric test is used as an indicator of xenobioticrelated damage to the cellular membrane, when they are already in an
advanced stage of cell death process [87,88].
In Fig. 8, comparative results after direct contact of the keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts with ZnO and Al2O3 coatings are displayed.
The uncoated cotton does not have any cytotoxic eﬀect as compared
with cellular references, as known in literature [89]. ZnO has cytotoxic
potential reﬂected by the decrease of cell viability (lower MTS). However, the MTS decrease is not correlated with the disintegration of the
cell membranes. The cotton and viscose samples coated with Al2O3 did
not exhibit cytotoxic eﬀects.
Fig. 9 shows the results after indirect contact of the keratinocytes
and ﬁbroblasts with metallic oxide coatings. MTS and LDH parameters
were evaluated.
The cotton reference does not manifest any cytotoxic eﬀect as
compared with the cellular references. The textile samples coated with
ZnO show cytotoxic potential evidenced by a signiﬁcant decrease of
MTS. However, there is a possible interference of the tested material
with LDH absorbance, due to the fact that no increase of cell membrane
disintegration was observed. Al2O3 coating did not show cytotoxic

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have demonstrated the development of conformal
thin layers of metal oxides on cellulose-based natural and artiﬁcial

fabrics with signiﬁcant antibacterial capabilities. Low temperature ALD
coatings were applied on cotton and viscose by employing ZnO and
Al2O3, in order to develop ﬂexible organic-inorganic composites.
The antibacterial experiments revealed that ZnO is superior to Al2O3
in controlling the bacteria growth, and the viscose – metal oxides
composites are more eﬃcient than the cotton-based ones. Direct and
indirect cytotoxicity studies suggested that the fabrics covered with
ZnO had cytotoxic potential by decreasing the cell viability, but no cell
membrane alteration was reported. Al2O3 proved to be safe for the
human cells involved in the research.

Abstract: Biological silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using the marine endophytic
fungus Aspergillus tubingensis and inhibited Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation at low concentrations.
Cotton and polyester fabrics impregnated with AgNPs were analyzed by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and the concentration of AgNPs in both fabrics was determined using inductivelycoupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The fabrics carrying the AgNPs inhibited
the Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli growth by 100%. Both fabrics impregnated one time
with AgNPs inhibited yeasts' clinical species' growth, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and
Candida parapsilosis, from 80.1% to approximately 98.0%. Besides the anti-biofilm effect, the AgNPs
impregnation process on cotton and polyester fabrics was highly efficient, and both fabrics presented
antimicrobial effects against clinically relevant bacteria and yeast species. The results evidence that
functionalized textiles containing these biological AgNPs can play an essential role in combating
pathogenic microorganisms. Thereby offering an alternative to design effective solutions, mainly for
hospital garments and biomedical devices, to avoid microorganisms transmissions and hospitalacquired nosocomial infections.

1. Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance has threatened the lives of a considered number of hospitalized
patients worldwide [1]. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) possess invaluable applications across
different sectors, and the application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in particular, has proved
to be advantageous due to their antimicrobial activity against several clinically relevant
pathogens [2]. As part of the effort to combat hospital-acquired infections, a high priority topic
nowadays, functional materials able to inhibit pathogens' growth are very relevant [3, 4].
While researchers have produced large knowledge about the synthesis of nanomaterials
employing physical [5] and chemical [6] methods, high energy costs and the use of chemical

https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC116.1476414774

reagents in these conventional methods is a serious problem with high environmental impact
[7]. Consequently, biological approaches provide a significant advantage as a means to obtain
MNP. There are several options of eco-friendly methods to synthesize nanoparticles, and plants
[8] and microorganisms [9, 10] have been the main source of bioactive molecules that can
synthesize MNP through metal bioreduction, thereby decreasing their toxicity and
bioavailability [11]. Although the synthesis of MNP using bacterial bioactive molecules is
prevalent, fungi present numerous advantages related to the process and production of MNP.
Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of studies of biological
MNPs. However, despite our group's scientific contributions concerning the use of Aspergillus
tubingensis to synthesize AgNPs, these nanoparticles' effects have not been comprehensively
investigated to date.
Previously, we have demonstrated that AgNPs efficiently inhibit Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria when impregnated on fabrics at low concentrations [9].
The current study is describing the biosynthesis of AgNPs using the fungus A.
tubingensis followed by the evaluation of cotton and polyester fabrics carrying these AgNPs.
Moreover, this study brings new information through the evaluation of the bacterial biofilm
inhibition and the fabrics' antimicrobial activity. The application of biological AgNPs,
synthesized by A. tubingensis, with antibacterial and antifungal activity in textiles is an
attractive purpose that can be explored for hospital garments to avoid microorganisms
transmissions and hospital infections.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Fungus morphology analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The fungus A. tubingensis was previously isolated from Rizhophora mangle following
the method previously described [12] and deposited at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute Collection
(IOC, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) and at the Collection of Microorganisms for Biocontrol of
Plant, Pathogens and Weeds from "Embrapa Recursos Genéticos e Biotecnologia
(CENARGEN, Brasília, DF, Brazil)" under the number IOC 4684 and CEN1066, respectively.
After the growth in potato dextrose agar (PDA), the fungus was fixed with a modified
Karnovsky solution (paraformaldehyde at 2.5% and glutaraldehyde at 2.5% in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2)) and CaCl2 0.001 M [13]. After the fixation, the cells were washed
thrice with the same buffer for 15 min and dehydrated in a graded series of acetone (15%, 30%,
50%, 75%, 95%, 100%) for 15 min. The last step was repeated three times, and after that, the
sample was subjected to critical point drying with CO2 (Leica CPD 030). Samples were covered
with a gold film (in Sputter EMITEC for 4 min under 25 mA) and examined by SEM (LEO
Gemini 982, SEM at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV). Images were acquired by secondary
electron analysis and analyzed concerning modifications or ultrastructure arrangements in the
cell morphology.
2.2. Silver nanoparticles biosynthesis.

The A. tubingensis fungus was grown in PDA at 28 °C for a week and used for the
AgNPs biosynthesis, as previously reported [2]. The AgNPs biosynthesis was monitored using
UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) from 200 until 800 nm during 96 h, and the AgNPs
were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), average diameter size

determination, size distribution, and zeta potential by photon correlation spectroscopy
NanoSizer (Malvern Instruments Corp., Worcestershire, UK) [2].
2.3. Impregnation of silver nanoparticles on cotton and polyester fabrics by the Padding
method.

To impregnate the AgNPs on cotton and polyester fabrics, the material was first
washed, sterilized in an autoclave, and dried at room temperature (RT). Fabrics measuring 10
cm2 were immersed into 10 mL of AgNPs dispersion until complete wetting and subsequently
compressed between two rolling pins, using a rolling machine (Marcato, Padova, Italy). The
fabrics were impregnated with AgNPs one, two, and four times and dried at RT protected from
light for 24 h.
2.4. Concentration of silver in the AgNPs and on the impregnated cotton and polyester fabrics.

The silver concentration in the nanoparticles and on the impregnated fabrics was
determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP OES5100 VDV,
Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) by comparison with a standard calibration curve prepared
with silver, as previously reported [9].
2.5. Analysis of cotton and polyester fabrics morphology by SEM.

The morphology of the cotton and polyester fabrics with and without the AgNPs
incorporation was analyzed using SEM and images were acquired (JEOL JSM - T300
microscopy, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 kV with secondary electron detectors. Samples were prepared
using aluminum support (stubs) covered with a double-sided tape recovered with gold by 100
s. Images were recorded by a Proscan high-speed slow-scan CCD camera and processed in the
Analysis 3.0 system.
2.6. Antimicrobial activity of fabrics carrying silver nanoparticles.

The antimicrobial activity assays were performed as previously reported [9]. To
determine the antibacterial activity, the cotton and polyester fabrics (1 cm2) carrying the AgNPs
were incubated with suspensions of a mid-logarithmic phase culture of Escherichia coli (ATCC
25922) or Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) in a poor-broth nutrient medium (1 % bactotryptone and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl) in the concentration of 1×105 CFU/mL. Cultures were carried
out in triplicate at 30 °C and 150 rpm, and the bacterial growth was determined after 24 h by
the absorbance of the suspensions at 595 nm. Gentamicin at 8 and 16 μg/mL (17.0−34.0 μM)
was used as a positive control, and untreated bacteria were used as the negative control. The
percentage of bacterial growth inhibition was calculated by comparison with the negative
control.
To evaluate the antifungal activity, fragments of the fabrics (1 cm2) were placed in glass
tubes with 0.8 mL of distilled sterile water and mixed for 10 min in a rotary stirrer (Labnet
211DS, Edison, New Jersey, USA) at 220 rpm. Each sample received 2.2 mL of potato dextrose
(PD) broth and was incubated with 10 µL of a suspension of Candida albicans (ATCC 36802),
Candida glabrata (IOC 4565), or Candida parapsilosis (IOC 4564) at 1.87 x 105 CFU/mL
(prepared according to a standard curve previously established in our laboratory), at 32-35 ºC
and 220 rpm for 24 h. After incubation, 10 µL of each suspension was serially diluted, and
https://biointerfaceresearch.com/

14766

https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC116.1476414774

each dilution was incubated in a dish plate containing PDA at 32 ºC for at least 48 h. The score
of CFU/mL was counted and calculated by comparing it against the negative control.
The pathogens C. glabrata (IOC 4565) and C. parapsilosis (IOC 4564) are clinically
isolated strains from the Microbiology Department at Sao Paulo Federal University (Sao Paulo,
Brazil) deposited at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute Collection (IOC, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil).
2.7. Anti-biofilm action of silver nanoparticles - analysis by SEM.

The bacterium Bacillus subtilis was cultivated on Müller-Hinton agar at 37 °C, and a
suspension in PBS (pH 7.2), with an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm, was prepared. To analyze
the biofilm formation, 2 mL of this suspension was added to each well of a 12 well microplate
containing sterile coverslips of 13 mm diameter in each well. Each well was treated with 10
μL of AgNO3 or diluted AgNPs, resulting in final concentrations of 8, 16, and 32 μM, and the
plate was incubated at 28 °C at 150 rpm for 24 h. Controls were performed with untreated
bacterial cells, or bacterial cells treated with streptomycin/penicillin (2,500 UI/mL/2.5
mg/mL).
For the SEM, the B. subtilis was treated with 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 50 µM of AgNPs or
AgNO3 as control. Samples were fixed and processed as described above and were dehydrated
in a graded series of ethanol solution (30–100%). The critical point drying was performed with
CO2 in a CPD 030 equipment (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), and samples
were covered with a gold film and observed using SEM (FEI QUANTA 250 SEM,
Netherlands) and accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Images were obtained by secondary electron
analysis [14] and analyzed considering modifications or ultrastructure arrangements on the cell
morphology.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. A. tubingensis morphology by SEM.

Although the fungus A. tubingensis strain had been previously identified by molecular
analysis [2], in this study, we are showing its morphology by SEM (Figure 1). The fungus
isolates proliferated rapidly on PDA. The colonies were white initially, turned greyish, and
finally black within 3-4 days. Conidiophores and conidia were present in a high amount, and
there was high sporulation. The morphological characteristics are according to Aspergillus sp.
previous identification [15].

3.2. Silver nanoparticle formation, the concentration of silver in it, and in the impregnated
cotton and polyester fabrics.

The formation of AgNPs was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy for at least 96 h. The
brownish color formation, together with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band around
420-430 nm was observed and is evidence of AgNPs formation. Nanoparticles size observed
employing TEM was 35 ± 10 nm, uniform and equitably distributed, as first reported [2] (data
not showed).
The silver concentration present in the AgNPs determined by ICP OES was 93 ± 23
mg, corresponding to 86.2 ± 21.3% of the theoretical value (107.9 mg). This data is related to
the fungal filtrate reaction's efficacy, with AgNO3 showing a high reaction yield.
AgNPs incorporation on the fabrics was effective. However, there was a substantial
difference in AgNPs impregnations between cotton and polyester. The percentage of AgNPs
incorporated on the cotton fabric was 2.7%, 2.7%, and 12.5%, with one, two, and four
impregnations, respectively.

For polyester fabric, the impregnation pointed out to uniform AgNPs incorporation
reaching 9.9%, 9.3%, and 8.4% when impregnated one, two, and four times, respectively. As
can be observed, there was no significant variation among the repetitions.
Figures 2 and 3 represent the SEM of polyester and cotton fabrics before and after
incorporating AgNPs. It is possible to observe the AgNPs on the surface of the fabrics. It can
be seen that the amount of AgNPs adhered to the cotton fabric surface that suffered four
impregnations, as expected, is higher than other impregnation procedures.
Most likely, there was a saturation of the polyester fabric after the first impregnation.
This was not observed on cotton, in which the most efficient impregnation process was repeated
four times. The AgNPs adhered on the fabric's surface, mainly for the cotton fabric impregnated
four times, as observed by SEM. The profile of AgNPs incorporation in cotton fabric is similar
to that obtained using biological AgNPs from Fusarium oxysporum [16].
3.3. Antimicrobial activity of fabrics impregnated with AgNPs.

Previously, the antimicrobial activity of biogenic AgNPs produced by A. tubingensis
on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and on several species of clinical strains of
Candida sp. was reported, and the nanoparticles showed high antibacterial and antifungal effect
[2].
In this study, both fabrics impregnated only once with AgNPs inhibited S. aureus and
E. coli growth by 100%.
C. albicans is usually present in infections caused by yeasts, and due to that, both
fabrics, cotton and polyester, carrying the AgNPs were first tested on this yeast species. The
cotton impregnated with AgNPs one, two, and four times inhibited the C. albicans by 80.1,
80.6, and 83.5%, respectively, while the polyester fabric effect was similar, inhibiting 86.3,
85.1, and 76.2% of the yeast growth, respectively.
The antifungal effect of both fabrics carrying AgNPs impregnated one time was also
observed on C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata, which were inhibited by 96.9 and 97.7%,
respectively. On C. albicans and C. parapisilosis, the polyester fabric was more effective than
the cotton and inhibited the growth efficiently by 86.3% and 97.7%. The inhibition induced by
the cotton fabric carrying AgNPs on both yeasts was 80.1% and 96.9. The cotton fabric
carrying the AgNPs was more effective against C. glabrata and inhibited the growth by 97.9%,
whereas the polyester inhibition was 94.2%.
Both fabrics showed remarkable antimicrobial effects against clinically relevant
pathogens. Cotton fabric carrying AgNPs in different concentrations presented similar
activities against C. albicans, and the fabric impregnated four times (12.5% of AgNPs) showed
slightly higher growth inhibition. The increase of 4.6 fold in the concentration of AgNPs from
one to four impregnations was not relevant for improving the antifungal activity that increased
only from 80.1 to 83.5%. Likewise, polyester fabric with similar percentages of impregnated
AgNPs also presented high growth inhibition for all impregnations. Thus, in both cases, only
one impregnation of the fabrics with AgNPs was enough for achieving the nanoparticles'
concentration and provided the significant antifungal effect of AgNPs textiles. Moreover, both
fabrics carrying the AgNPs impregnated once efficiently inhibited C. parapsilosis and C.
glabrata growth. The data shows that functionalized textiles were efficient in killing the
pathogens, despite carrying AgNPs in low percentage.
The current data corroborate previous data from our laboratory, which show that cotton
and polyester fabric carrying biological AgNPs obtained from the fungus Bionectria
https://biointerfaceresearch.com/

14769

https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC116.1476414774

ochroleuca were very effective in inhibiting pathogenic yeasts and bacteria growth [9]. It is
interesting to observe that the impregnation process by only one time is enough for obtaining
fabrics carrying AgNPs in concentrations able to kill the yeasts. Besides, it is an advantage for
future manufacturing. In a scale-up process, a small number of steps and a lower concentration
of AgNPs for impregnation are advantageous to save both money and time, and the data
presented here support this perspective.
3.4. Anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs.

The anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs was evaluated against B. subtilis exposed to AgNPs
in concentrations between 0.01 to 50 µM (Figure 4). AgNPs at 8 µM inhibited the biofilm
formation, but this effect did not increase when the bacteria were exposed to higher AgNPs
concentration (Figure 5). AgNO3 inhibited biofilm formation in all assayed concentrations as
well as the antibiotic streptomycin/penicillin (2,500 UI/mL/2.5 mg/mL – data not showed) used
as control.
It is known that biofilm is a reservoir for pathogens in the hospital environment and
medical devices and should be carefully and entirely eliminated. Functionalization of materials
with AgNPs by coating or impregnation is a promising alternative to avoid microorganisms
dissemination and biofilm formation [17].
B. subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium usually found in the environment; however, it
can cause diseases in humans like diarrhea and urinary tract infections, and even fatal infections
[18]. Considering its relevance, in this study, the AgNPs were evaluated on B. subtilis and
showed an anti-biofilm effect, also observed in the SEM results.

GraphPad Prism 5.0 software by two-way ANOVA / Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests. Differences in
relation to the control values were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Literature data highlights the efficient antibacterial activity of AgNPs, even at low
concentrations. AgNPs obtained from aqueous and ethanolic extract of Andrographis
paniculata stem showed antibacterial effect on B. Subtilis [19], and that from
exopolysaccharide of the bacterium Mesoflavibacter zeaxanthinifaciens also showed an antibiofilm effect on B. Subtilis [18].

The antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles is attributed to oxidative stress and the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause disruption of microorganisms'
membranes and their death [20]. Due to the small sizes, MNPs have a high surface area, and
this property is advantageous for inhibiting biofilm formation, which promotes a direct
interaction of nanoparticles and cell surfaces.
Biofilms are formed by the association of microorganisms able to maintain the
communication and cooperation related to metabolism, gene expression, and virulence [21].
These mechanisms for survival have been adapted through the microorganisms' evolution,
increasing their resistance to antimicrobial agents and protection from host defenses [22]. This
interaction process among the cells can probably be modified by the presence of small
nanoparticles that can penetrate the cells, interrupting communication and metabolism,
inducing death as a result.
The biological AgNPs applied in this study have a size of 35 ± 10 nm (TEM) and
positive zeta potential on their surface (+7.8) [2]. These properties are interesting to promote
the interaction with bacterium cells. Although AgNPs showed an excellent antimicrobial
activity and inhibited the biofilm formation at lower concentrations, unexpectedly, biofilm
formation was not inhibited at higher concentrations. This result was observed in both analyses,
and one hypothesis is that at higher concentrations, saturation and/or aggregation of the AgNPs
may have occurred, which could not inhibit the cells' interactions, leading to biofilm formation.
It is established that biofilms develop the extracellular matrix (ECM), which has a protective
function in limiting the access of antimicrobial agents by physical contact or reducing the
penetration rate and consequently the effectivity [23]. This is a reasonable explanation for the
phenomenon observed here.
An extracellular polymeric substance such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipopeptides, and
poly-gamma-glutamate (PGA) can be secreted by B. subtilis [24] and due to their tertiary
structure and chemical properties, some of these compounds can react with metals. They can
https://biointerfaceresearch.com/

14771

https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC116.1476414774

be applied for bioremediation of contaminated soils [25]. Eymard-Vernain et al. [26] showed
that synthetic AgNPs surrounded by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) presented no significant
effect on the intracellular physiology of B. subtilis during the stationary phase and that the
secreted bioorganic molecules – PGA - interacted with the AgNPs. PGA may physically
interact with the AgNPs by trapping them, thereby decreasing their bioavailability and,
consequently, the biocidal effect [26]. It may have occurred when the B. subtilis tested herein
was exposed to higher concentrations of AgNPs. Perhaps the most stressful condition had
stimulated a higher PGA production (or any other specific proteins to resist environmental
stresses), neutralizing the AgNP effect, allowing the bacterial growth, as observed when the
bacteria were exposed to increasing concentrations of AgNP.
The effect of AgNPs on the biofilm observed in this study agrees with previous data
showing that bacteria from mature bacterial biofilm [27, 28] or stationary phase [24] are more
resistant to AgNPs. Although no doubt exists about the biological AgNPs anti-biofilm effect at
low concentrations, additional studies are necessary to understand its interaction with B.
subtilis biofilm in different concentrations.
4. Conclusions
This research showed that the impregnation of cotton and polyester fabrics with AgNP
was very efficient, and both fabrics showed strong antimicrobial effects against clinically
relevant pathogens and excellent antimicrobial activity of the free AgNPs against such
pathogens.
Further research could be useful to determine the threshold of the inhibition of the
microorganisms' growth by AgNPs, its use even at lower concentrations on fabrics, and better
understand the process of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect.
It can be anticipated that the applications of functionalized textiles containing AgNPs
will play a key role in the near future in combating pathogenic strains, thereby offering an
alternative to design effective solutions against hospital-acquired nosocomial infections.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), silver oxide nanoparticles (AgO-NPs), and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs)
have healing, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, Ag-NPs and ZnO-NPs also have antiinflammatory properties. In this study, we synthesized a nanocomposite using Ag-ZnO and AgO-NPs (Ag-ZnO/
AgO NPs). The structural and morphological properties of nanocrystals and nanocomposite were investigated by
X-ray diffraction and scanning electronics microscopic. The wurtzite crystalline structure of Ag-ZnO and two
morphologies for the nanocomposite (nanorods and nanoplatelets) were determined. Topical treatment with 1%
Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs was compared to untreated wounds (control group). Wounds were induced in the dorsal region
of BALB/c mice and evaluated after 3, 7, 14, and 21 days of treatment. The nanocomposite demonstrated antiinflammatory and antioxidant capacities. In addition, wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed accelerated
closure, non-cytotoxicity, especially on keratinocytes and collagen deposition, and increased metalloproteinases
2 and 9 activity. The nanocomposite improved healing by reducing the inflammatory process, protecting tissues
from damage caused by free radicals, and increasing collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix. These
characteristics contributed to the accelerated wound closure process. Thus, Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs show potential for
can be a strategy for topical use in formulations of new drugs to treat wounds.

1. Introduction
The care of wounds is a significant financial burden on the health
system, with a global annual cost of approximately $ 2.8 billion in 2014
and a projected cost of $ 3.5 billion in 2021 (Sen, 2019). Any change
during the stages of healing (inflammation, proliferation, and remod­
eling) can lead to the appearance of chronic ulcers and/or excessive
scarring (Landén et al., 2016). At the cellular level, delayed healing may
be associated with persistent inflammation, high levels of reactive ox­
ygen species (ROS), reduced migration and proliferation of fibroblasts

and keratinocytes, reduced collagen production, and inadequate pro­
duction of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) (Krzyszczyk et al., 2018; Ler­
man et al., 2003; Loots et al., 2002).
When healing is compromised, treatment is necessary, and silver
compounds are often used (White, 2001). Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs)
stimulate healing in skin wounds (Ahmadi and Adibhesami, 2017; Seo
et al., 2017) and in second-degree burn models (Wasef et al., 2020).
They also have anti-inflammatory effects (Hamdan et al., 2017) and
promote the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (Vijaya­
kumar et al., 2019). Oxidized Ag-NPs in oxidized form (AgO-NPs) have

the advantages of safety, stability, ease of dispersion, and lack of skin
irritation (Gouda, 2012; Sanchez-Moreno et al., 2018). AgO-NPs have
antioxidant and healing effects on venous ulcers (Belcaro et al., 2011;
Ravichandran et al., 2016) and are associated with silk fibroin. AgO-NPs
have also been found to stimulate the migration of fibroblasts in vitro
(Babu et al., 2018). Despite these promising aspects, their potential as
agents for treatment and wound healing is poorly understood.
Recent studies have proposed the association of Ag-NPs and zinc
oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) (Bayrami et al., 2020; Kantipudi et al.,
2018). Ag-ZnO-NPs have been shown to have a healing effect based on
wound closure results and morphological analysis (Kantipudi et al.,
2017). The immobilization of Ag-NPs by inorganic compounds such as
ZnO makes Ag-NPs less prone to aggregation and oxidation when
exposed to watery environments (Dallas et al., 2010). ZnO-NPs are
considered biocompatible compounds (Tankhiwale and Bajpai, 2012).
In addition to ensuring greater stability, zinc can increase collagen
synthesis and contribute to re-epithelization (Lansdown et al., 2007). In
a nanoparticle form, ZnO-NPs have anti-inflammatory (Kim and Jeong,
2015; Manuja et al., 2020) and healing effects (Manuja et al., 2020).
Considering the using ZnO-NPs for stabilization and safety of AgNPs, as well as the potential of Ag-NPs, AgO-NPs, and ZnO-NPs, we
synthesized a nanocomposite of silver-doped zinc oxide associated with
silver oxide nanocrystals (Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs) and evaluated its effect on
the healing of skin wounds. This nanocomposite showed antibacterial
activity against Echerichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Sousa, 2019),
commonly found in contaminated wounds (Usanga et al., 2020).
Furthermore, Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs have demonstrated cell viability in HFF
fibroblasts up to a concentration of 250 µg/mL (Justino et al., 2019).

2. Materials

3.4. Treatment groups

For the in vitro assays, the cell lines (HaCat e L292) were provided by
Professor Míriam Tereza Paz Lopes of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais. DMEM medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium), peni­
cillin/streptomycin antibiotics and dimethyl dulfoxide (DMSO) were
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was acquired
from Gibco-Life Technologies and MTT (3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromite) was purchased from Invitrog.
The materials used in the animal testings were acquired from the
following sources: Now Solution and Cero for lanolin and vaseline,
respectively, Syntec® for ketamine and xylazine, and Thiopental® for
Thipental. Methanol, acetic acid and chloroform were purchased from
Synth. For the morphological evaluations, the following stains were
used: hematoxylin, gomori trichomic and picrosirius red (SigmaAldrich), eosin and toluidine blue (Synth).
Reagents used in biochemical analysis HTAB (Hexadecyl­
trimethylmonium bromide), TMB (3.3 ’, 5.5′ – tetramethylbenzidine),
TPTZ (2,4,6-tri (2 pyridyl)-s-triazine), Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra­
methylchroman − 2-carboxylic acid), p-nitrophenyl-n-acetyl-β-D-glu­
cosaminidase, thiobarbituric acid, trichloroacetic acid, pyrogallol,
EDTA, acrylamide and gelatin, Bradford reagent, protease inhibitor,
Comassie Blue and triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
and H2SO4 was obtainded from Merck.

Information about the experimental groups is presented in Table 1.
The animals were treated daily, at the same time. For each wound in
vehicle and Ag-ZnO/AgO-NPs groups, a daily dose of 100 mg of treat­
ment was applied. For the preparation of the Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs oint­
ment, Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs were macerated with mortar and pestle until
obtaining a fine powder that was incorporated into the vehicle at 1%
concentration. In addition to the control group (induced and untreated
wounds), a group treated with the vehicle (lanolin and vaseline) was
added, according to (Ozay, 2013; Toker et al., 2009), in order to iden­
tify/minimize possible effects of the vehicle that may influence the
treatment with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs.

3.2. Cell viability
The cell viability was evaluated in keratinocytes (HaCat) fibroblasts
(L292). These cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 1%
penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS. The cells were seeded in 96-well
plates with 5x103 cells per well. Then they were incubated, overnight, in
a CO2 oven (5%) at 37 ◦ C and treated with 1% DMSO and DMEM me­
dium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. After 24 h, the cells received AgZnO/AgO NPs at 5; 25; 35; 50; 65; 85; 100 μg/mL, and DMSO (1%).
HaCat and L291 were incubated with this treatment for 24 h. Then, the
cell viability was quantified using the colorimetric reagent MTT. After 3
h of incubation with 10 µL MTT diluted in 90 µL DMEM with 0.5% FBS,
the absorbance was measured using the ELISA plate reader at a wave­
length of 570 nm (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA) (Kumar
et al., 2018a). The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration of cells) was
obtained (Martinho et al., 2012).
3.3. Animals
The experimental animal protocols were approved by the Ethics
Committee on the Use of Animals of the Federal University of
Uberlândia (CEUA/UFU-44/2017). Ninety-six male BALB/c mice,
healthy, weighing approximately 27 g with nine weeks old were used.
The animals were provided and maintained by the Rede de Biotérios de
Roedores (REBIR-UFU) under standard conditions (22 ± 1 ◦ C, humidity
60 ± 5% and 12 h of light / 12 h dark) and water and food ad libitum.

3.5. Induction and evaluation of wound closure
The animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The animals had trichotomized

3.1. Synthesis and characterization of Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs
The synthesis of the ZnO nanocrystals and nanocomposites (Agdoped ZnO and AgO nanocrystals-sample ZnO7Ag) was patented ac­
cording to process number BR 10 2018 0,077,147 - Instituto Nacional da
Propriedade Industrial. The crystal structures of nanocrystals and nano­
composites were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a diffractom­
eter XDR-6000 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) operated at 20 kV and 2 mA
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphologies of the nano­
materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

back hair and the area were cleaned with 70% alcohol. Four wounds
were induced with a 5 mm punch on the back of each animal. Then, the
diameter of each wound was obtained with a digital caliper (150 mmMatrix) and considered as day zero. The diameters of these wounds were
obtained again at the end of each treatment time, after 3, 7, 14 and 21
days. Macroscopic images of the wounds in these same periods were
obtained with a digital camera (Sony Cybershot 14,1 DSC W320). The
percentage of wound closure was calculated using the following equa­
tions (Pinto et al., 2016):

3.9. Sample preparation for oxidative stress assays: Ferric ion reducing
antioxidant power, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and superoxide
dismutase and catalase activities
Half wound from each animal was homogenized in 500 µL of 20 mM
sodium phosphate buffer containing 140 mM KCl, pH 7.4. After ho­
mogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 800 xg for 10 min at 4 ◦ C.
The pellets were discarded and the supernatants were collected for the
quantification of antioxidant and oxidative stress parameters.
3.9.1. Ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)
The FRAP method allows the quantification of antioxidant capacity
from the reduction of Fe+3 in Fe+2 by the antioxidants present in the
samples (Benzie and Strain, 1999). Fe+3 is chelated by TPTZ to form the
intense blue-colored Fe+2-TPTZ. The FRAP reagent solution was pre­
pared with 10 mL of acetate, 1 mL of TPTZ and 1 mL of Fe+3. The su­
pernatant (35 µL) was mixed with 250 µL of FRAP reagent in a 96-well
microplate. Trolox was used as standard. The assay was done in dupli­
cate. The absorbance was measured in an ELISA reader at 400 nm
(Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and the results were
expressed as µmol trolox eq/mg protein.

3.9.2. Thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS)
The reaction of free radicals with lipids from cell membranes is called
lipoperoxidation. The lipoperoxidation leads to the formation of
malondialdehyde (MDA), which may react with thiobarbituric acid and
form colored compounds (Yagi, 1998). In microtube, 100 µL of sample
supernatant, 200 µL of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 300 µL of 0.67%
thiobarbituric acid, in sodium sulfate, were incubated for 2 h in water
bath. After the incubation, the samples were cooled for 5 min. Then, 400
µL of butanol was added, and the samples were centrifuged at 5,000 at xg
at 3 min. The upper phase (300 µL), organic phase containing the
pigment, was used for the fluorescence measurements (Perkin-Elmer LS
55, Massachusetts, USA) at 515 nm (excitation) and 553 nm (emission).
The analysis was done in duplicate and the results were expressed as
nmol TBARS/mg protein.

After 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment, the animals were euthanized
by anesthetic deepening with Thiopental intraperitoneally. The skin on
the back was removed and the wound samples were obtained with a 5
mm punch. One of the wounds was immediately fixed in Metacarn so­
lution (methanol, acetic acid and chloroform 6:3:1, v/v) and submitted
to histological processing. The other three samples from each animal
were stored at − 80 ◦ C in ultra-freezer for biochemical analysis.
3.7. Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO)
Neutrophil activity was obtained by indirect assessment of MPO
activity using the Bradley technique (Bradley et al., 1982). In summary,
one wound from each animal was homogenized in 2 mL of 80 mM so­
dium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Subsequently, 600 μL of HTAB was
added in a microtube containing 300 µL of homogenate. The samples
were sonicated and centrifuged at 2,700 xg for 10 min at 4 ◦ C⋅H2O2 and
TMB were added simultaneously to the supernatant for 1 min. The
enzymatic reaction was stopped with H2SO4. The mixtures (200 μL)
were inserted into the 96-well plate and the absorbance was obtained in
an ELISA reader at 450 nm (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA).
The analysis was performed in duplicate and the results were given as
MPO index (absorbance in optical density/g of wet weight of the
wound).

3.9.3. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
SOD catalyzes the dismutation of two superoxide radicals (O2⋅-) to
H2O2 and molecular oxygen. The method used in this study is based on
inhibiting the reaction of the superoxide radical with pyrogallol (Mar­
klund, 1985). The oxidation of pyrogallol leads to the formation of a
colored compound, detected in the spectrophotometer at 420 nm (Mo­
lecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA). In summary, a mix containing
SOD buffer (50 mM tris buffer with 1 mM EDTA pH 8.2) and 80 U/mL
catalase was prepared. In the microplate, 15 µL of the sample, 216 µL of
this mix and 20 µL of 24 mM pirogalol in 10 mM HCl were added. The
assay was evaluated in duplicate and the results were obtained using a
standard SOD curve and expressed as units of SOD/mg of protein.

3.8. N- Acetyl- β- D- glucosaminidase activity (NAG)
NAG was used as an indirect measurement of macrophage activity,
according to the Bailey technique (Bailey, 1988). Half of a wound from
each animal was homogenized in 2.0 mL of 0.9% saline with 0.1% Triton
X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged at 960 xg for 10 min at 4 ◦ C,
and the supernatant (150 µL) was collected and added to a citrate/
phosphate buffer (150 µL). This mixture (100 μL) was applied to the 96well plate with 100 μL of substrate (p-nitrophenyl-n-acetyl-β-D-gluco­
saminidase). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 ◦ C, and the
reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 10.6,
to the samples. The absorbance was measured in an ELISA reader at 400
nm (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The enzymatic activity
was obtained in duplicate and the results were expressed as nmol mL− 1/
mg of wet weight of the implant.

3.9.4. Catalase (CAT) activity
CAT is an enzyme produced by peroxisomes that converts H2O2 into
water and oxygen. In this test, it is possible to identify high concentra­
tions of H2O2 by increases in absorbance (Aebi, 1984). Triton at 10%
was added to the sample supernatant and the homogenate was agitated
and left to rest on ice for 15 min. A mix containing H2O2 and 10 mM
potassium phosphate buffer was added to the sample and the absor­
bances were read in a 96-well microplate at 240 nm (Perkin-Elmer LS
55, Massachusetts, USA) for 10 min, with 15 s intervals. The assay was
done in duplicate and the results were expressed as catalase unit/g of
protein.
3.10. Morphological evaluation
Samples embedded in paraffin were cut into 5 µm of thickness in a
rotating microtome (MICROM / HM-315). The quantification of mast

cells, blood vessels and collagen were performed in photomicrographs
stained with 0.25% Toluidine Blue in a MacIlvaine pH 3.0, gomori tri­
chomic and picrosirius red, respectively (Barbosa et al., 2021). For
qualitative analysis, slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.
E). Photomicrographs for quantification of mast cells, blood vessels and
general analysis by H.E were obtained using a Leica Microsystems Inc.
microscope (Wetzlar) with a 40x objective (400x magnitude). For the
quantification of total collagen and type I and type III collagen, the
images were captured in the Nikon eclipse Ti camera with polarization
filter with 20x objective (200x magnitude). Random areas (10) of each
slide, one slide per animal, were analyzed. The average obtained after
the quantification of these areas (total value of all areas/10) was used for
statistical analysis. Quantifications were performed using the Image J
software (Rasband, 2011). The number of mast cells and blood vessels
were obtained with the multipoint tool. For total collagen and types I
and III collagen analysis, image J was previously calibrated. For total
collagen, the images were converted into 8-bits (gray scale) and quan­
tified with the delimitation of the collagen area using the threshold tool.
The differentiation of types I and III collagen was performed in sepa­
ration channels using the split channel tool. Then, the images were
quantified through the threshold tool (De Moura et al., 2021; Junqueira
et al., 1979).
3.11. Metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activities
The enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by the
zymography method (De Moura et al., 2021). One wound was homog­
enized with 200 µL of extraction buffer and incubated for 24 h at − 4 ◦ C.
The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 10 min and the super­
natants were collected. Total proteins in supernatants were quantified
(Bradford, 1976) and then applied (30 µg) to the zymography gel.
Separation gel containing 8% acrylamide and 0.4% gelatin was used.
After running the samples in electrophoresis, the gel was washed with
25% Triton X-100 buffer and incubated overnight at 37 ◦ C with the
incubation buffer containing protease inhibitor (2 µL of inhibitor/50 mL
of buffer). Then, the gel was stained with Comassie Blue for 2 h and
decolorized with a bleaching solution (acetic acid/methanol/water
1:5:50, v/v) until the visualization of the bands referring to the gelati­
nolytic activity of the enzymes. For this assay, 3 wounds per group of
animals were used; each sample was evaluated in triplicate. The gels
were scanned and the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were quantified
by band densitometry in Software Image J.

NPs). (A) X-ray diffraction patterns, (B) scanning electron microscopy images,
and (C) crystalline structures of Ag-ZnO NPs and AgO NPs, forming Ag-ZnO/

Therefore, the nanocomposite consisted of 44% Ag-doped ZnO nano­
crystals and 56% AgO nanocrystals. In Fig. 1 (B), the SEM image of ZnO
NCs showed the two morphologies (nanorods and nanoplatelets). Ag
incorporation increases the growth of the nanorod (see SEM image of
nanocomposite NCs), in according with the XRD results. Therefore, the
formation of ZnO NCs and Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs nanocomposite were
confirmed. Fig. 1 (C) shows the crystalline structures of Ag-doped ZnO
NPs and AgO NPs, forming Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs nanocomposite.

3.12. Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean and standard error, and were tested
for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Then, the
ANOVA one-way statistical test and Bonferroni post-test were carried
out comparing the Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs group with the control groups (CO
group) and vehicle group (Ve. group), considering p < 0.05. The sta­
tistical evaluation and graphs were performed using the GraphPad Prism
8® program.

4.2. Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs have greater viability on keratinocytes and lower
viability on fibroblasts

4. Results

The results of viability of the keratinocytes and fibroblasts treated
with Ag-ZnO/Ag NPs are presented in Fig. 2. The keratinocytes treated
with Ag-ZnO/Ag NPs had higher viability than the fibroblasts treated
with Ag-ZnO/Ag NPs. The viability of fibroblasts was reduced after
treatment with concentrations equal to or greater than 5 µg/mL, while
for keratinocytes, the reduction in viability was observed only when
these cells were treated with concentrations of 50 µg/mL, 65 µg/mL, 85
µg/mL and 100 µg/mL. IC50 values for keratinocytes (98.88 µg/mL) and
fibroblasts (103.7 µg/mL) were similar.

4.1. Synthesis and characterization of the nanocomposite (Ag-ZnO/AgO
NPs)
The structural and morphological properties of the nanomaterials are
shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 (A) shows the Bragg diffraction peaks charac­
teristics of ZnO with the wurtzite crystal structure (JCPDS 36–1451),
confirming the formation of ZnO-NCs. The inset observed the displace­
ment of the ZnO peaks and typical AgO peaks (JCPDS 43–1038). This
displacement result confirms the substitution of zinc by silver into the
crystalline structure of ZnO since Ag+2 has an ionic radius (1.26 Å)
larger than Zn+2 (0.74 Å), confirming the Ag-doped ZnO NPs formed.

4.3. Wounds treated with the nanocomposite accelerated closure

untreated wounds (CO group) (reductions of 65.9%, 36.6% and 82.3%,
after 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment, respectively). The activity of
neutrophils showed a reduction of 37.1% in the vehicle-treated wounds
(Ve group), when compared to the untreated wounds after 3 days. After
21 days, the activity of neutrophils showed a reduction of 82.7% in the
wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs in relation to the vehicle group
(Ve. group).
The activity of macrophages in the wound area was analyzed by
indirect evaluation of NAG (Fig. 4B). Macrophages’ activity reduced
48.1% in the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs, and 30% in the
wounds treated with the vehicle (Ve. group), both after 3 days of
treatment and compared with the CO group. After 21 days of treatment,
the activity of macrophages was lower in the wounds treated with AgZnO/AgO NPs than in the untreated wounds (CO group) and Ve.
group. These reductions were 48.8% and 38.0%, respectively. There was

The wound closure after 3, 7, 14 and 21 days was calculated (Fig. 3A)
and the macroscopic images were obtained (Fig. 3B). The animals
treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed an increase in wound closure of
28.4% and 7.71% after 7 and 14 days, respectively, when compared
with untreated wounds (CO group). There was no difference in wound
closure between the groups evaluated after 3 and 21 days of treatment.
4.4. Nanocomposite reduced neutrophil and macrophage activities in the
treated wounds
The assessment of neutrophils in the wound area was indirectly
measured by the activity of MPO (Fig. 4A). The treatment with Ag-ZnO/
AgO NPs reduced the activity of neutrophils when compared with the

NPs group after 3 days of treatment, when compared with the CO group.
The wounds treated with vehicle showed an increase of 100% in the
antioxidant activity in relation to the control group after 7 days of
treatment. In this same period, the wounds from Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs
group showed a reduction of 64.7% in the antioxidant capacity, when
compared to the wounds from vehicle group. The antioxidant activity in
the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed reductions of 32.5%
and 45.2% after 14 and 21 days of treatment, respectively, in relation to
the CO group. After 21 days, the total antioxidant capacity was also
lower in the wounds treated with vehicles (Ve. group) (activity 31.3%
lower than in the untreated wounds (CO group)).
The results of lipoperoxidation assessed by the TBARS are shown in
Fig. 5B. The statistical difference between the groups was observed only
after 7 days of treatment. The treatment with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed
reductions in lipid peroxidation of 72%, 43% and 99.5% after 7, 14 and
21 days, respectively, when compared with the untreated wounds (CO
group). The lipid peroxidation was also lower in this group (reductions
of 45.6%, after 14 days, and 38%, after 21 days) than in the vehicle
group.
SOD activity was measured by enzymatic assay and the results are

shown in Fig. 5C. There was no statistical difference in SOD activity
between the groups evaluated after 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment. In the
other hand, SOD activity was reduced in the wounds treated with vehicle
(Ve. group) and Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs after 21 days of treatment. These
reductions were 40.2% and 55.7%, respectively, in relation to the un­
treated wounds (CO group).
The results of CAT activity are presented in Fig. 5D. After 3 days of
treatment, the activity of this enzyme increased in the wounds treated
with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs. This increase was 125.2% and 307.7% in rela­
tion to the untreated wounds (CO group) and wounds treated with
vehicle (Ve. group), respectively. After 21 days, CAT activity also
increased 164% in the Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs group and 104% in the vehicle
group (Ve. group), compared with untreated wounds (CO group). There
was no change in CAT activity in the evaluated groups at the interme­
diate periods, 7 and 14 days of treatment.

in the number of mast cells in the injured area between the groups
(Fig. 6A and Fig. 6C). For this evaluation, statistical difference was
observed only after 14 days of treatment. In this period, the wounds
treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed an increase of 117.2% in the
number of mast cells; in the vehicle-treated wounds, this increase was
210.3%. Both assessments were statistically different from the untreated
wounds (CO group).

treatment. After 7 days of treatment, there was lower inflammatory
infiltrate in the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs when compared
to the untreated wounds (CO group); these results are shown in Fig. 8. A
lower amount of cell nucleus is observed in Fig. 8A (delimited by a
rectangle) and Fig. 8B (previous image in higher magnification). After
21 days of treatment, we observed that the wounds treated with AgZnO/AgO NPs showed reconstitution of hair follicles and sebaceous
glands. The region of these annexes is marked by an asterisk in Fig. 8A
and identified by the arrows in Fig. 8B.

relation to the wounds from untreated animals (CO group). The total
collagen intensity was also 21% greater in the vehicle-treated wounds
compared to the untreated wounds after 7 days.
The same slides used for the quantification of total collagen were also
evaluated under a polarization filter allowing to differentiate and
quantify types I and III collagen. The values for this quantification are
shown in Fig. 10A and Fig. 10B, and the representation of the photo­
micrographs obtained for this evaluation is shown in Fig. 10C. Statistical
difference was observed only between the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/
AgO NPs and untreated wounds (CO group). In this case, type I collagen
increased 78.2%, while type III collagen increased 66.7% in the wounds
from Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs group after 7 days of treatment. No statistical
difference was observed between the groups evaluated after 3, 14 and
21 days of treatment.

4.9. Activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 increased in the wounds treated
with nanocomposite
The results of densitometry quantification of the activities of proMMP-9 and MMP-9 active enzymes are shown in Fig. 11A and
Fig. 11B, respectively, and the zymography gels are shown in Fig. 11C.
The activity of pro-MMP-9 was higher in the wounds treated with AgZnO/AgO NPs than in the untreated wounds (CO group) after 21 days
of treatment, with an increase of 148.4%. In addition, the wounds
treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed pro-MMP-9 activity increased
after 7 (increase of 41.4%) and 21 (increase of 149.1%) days when
compared to the vehicle-treated wounds (Ve. group). With regard to the
activity of MMP-9 in active form, there was an increase of 80% after 3
days of treatment in the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs, in

relation to the untreated wounds (group CO). The increase in active
MMP-9 activity was also observed in this group after 7 days of treatment,
with increases of 64.2% and 116.4% in relation to the CO group and Ve.
Group, respectively. Pro-MMP9 and MMP-9 activities were not observed
for quantification after 14 days of treatment. The same occurred for
MMP-9 activity after 21 days.
We also quantified the activities of pro-MMP-2 and MMP-2 (Fig. 12A
and Fig. 12B, respectively). The bands representing the enzymatic ac­
tivities on zymography gel are shown in Fig. 12C. As occurred for MMP9 activity, the activities of both pro-MMP-2 and active form of this MMP
increased in the group of wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs. This
increase was observed at the beginning, after 3 days of treatment. In this
period, the activity of pro-MMP-2 increased 58.5% in the wounds
treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs when compared to the wounds without
treatment (CO group). After 7 days of treatment, pro-MMP2 activity in
the wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs increased 52.6% and 42.7%,
in comparison with the wounds treated with vehicle (Ve. group) and
untreated wounds (CO group), respectively. Considering the activity of
MMP-2 in its active form, there was an increase after 3 days of treatment
only in the wounds treated with vehicle (Ve. group) (increase of 82.8%

in relation to the untreated wounds (CO group)). The active MMP-9
activity was higher than 60.0% and 127% in the wounds treated with
Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs when compared to the untreated wounds (group CO)
after 7 and 21 days of treatment, respectively. Pro-MMP-2 was not
identified in the gel in wound samples treated for 14 and 21 days.
5. Discussion
In this study, we synthesized Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs nanocomposite and
evaluated its effect on wound healing. In their individual form, ZnO-NPs
and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs and AgO-NPs) have anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant activities (Govindappa et al., 2018; Ravichandran et al.,
2016; Safawo et al., 2018; Thatoi et al., 2016). They also have healing
capabilities (Belcaro et al., 2011; Manuja et al., 2020; Seo et al., 2017),
as does Ag-ZnO NPs nanocomposites (Kantipudi et al., 2018). In past
studies, the healing activity of Ag-ZnO NPs was only demonstrated by
wound closure assays and morphological analysis. Therefore, we pro­
posed a more detailed evaluation of the nanocomposite form (Ag-ZnO
NPs) with the addition of AgO-NPs. Including AgO-NPs is justified
because they also have antioxidant and healing actions, do not cause

skin irritation, and are safe and easy to prepare. They have also not been
studied in detail compared to other forms of silver compounds (Belcaro
et al., 2011; Gouda, 2012; Ravichandran et al., 2016; Sanchez-Moreno
et al., 2018).
Considering the effect of treatment with Ag-ZnO / AgO-NPs on cell
viability, the use of the nanocompound led to greater viability of kera­
tinocytes compared to fibroblasts. The ability to induce proliferation and
migration of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) has been observed with zinc
oxide coated nanoparticle treatment (Ag @ ZnO) (Majhi et al., 2021).
Ag@ZnO affect the migration process by inducing an increased
expression of Ki67 and vinculin in the proximal edge of the wounds
(Majhi et al., 2021). Zinc acts in the re-epithelialization process by
inducing the participation of integrin subunits that influence the
motility of keratinocytes in the repair phase (Barker, 2011; Eckes et al.,
2010). The effect of Ag-ZnO/AgO-NPs on keratinocytes was confirmed
by morphological evaluations. In these evaluations, we observed that
wounds treated with the nanocompound presented a thick layer of
keratinocytes in the epidermis. In contrast, this tissue had not yet been
reconstituted in untreated wounds.
Although concentrations of Ag-NPs up to 50 μg/mL have not
demonstrated a cytotoxic effect on NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts

(Syed et al., 2013) and Ag-ZnO/ AgO NPs have not altered the viability
of HFF fibroblasts (Sousa, 2019). We observed a reduction in L292
fibroblast viability at the concentrations evaluated. Our results
demonstrate a marked decrease in the viability of these cells up to 35 µg/
mL, with a gradual increase in viability up to a concentration of 100 µg/
mL.
Wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed accelerated wound
closure. This was expected since previous studies have shown that all
nanoparticles used to synthesize the nanocomposite (ZnO, Ag and AgO)
had healing activity (Belcaro et al., 2011; Manuja et al., 2020; Seo et al.,
2017). Among these, AgO-NPs were the least studied. Recent studies
have shown that AgO-NPs have effectively improved micro-circulation
and closed pressure ulcers (Belcaro et al., 2011). In addition, when
combined with silk fibroin, AgO-NPs stimulated the migration of fibro­
blasts in in vitro assays. ZnOAg-NPs have shown healing activity with
better results for wound closure than the standard Dermazin treatment
(Kantipudi et al., 2018). The healing activity has also been demonstrated
for the treatment with ZnO-NPs in association with propolis (Bayrami
et al., 2020). In the case of the nanocomposite (Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs), it is
not understood how the association of these nanoparticles can
contribute to healing. Our results demonstrated that in addition to

During inflammation, ROS such as superoxide (O2–) and H2O2 are
produced by neutrophils and macrophages and are essential for elimi­
nating pathogens (Hoffmann and Griffiths, 2018; Schäfer and Werner,
2008). ROS act as the main secondary messengers on different healing
events such as inflammation, angiogenesis, cell migration, proliferation,
and fibrogenesis and can be found in low concentrations in normal
wounds (André-Lévigne et al., 2017). Although ROS have these funda­
mental roles, when in excess, they can contribute to the prolongation
and deregulation of the inflammatory process, generating chronic
wounds that do not heal (Sanchez et al., 2018). Excessive ROS can cause
oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids, in addition to degrading
the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Kurahashi and Fujii, 2015). We have
shown that wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/ZnO NPs have increased CAT
activity during the inflammatory phase (after 3 days of treatment).
During this period, its substrate, H2O2, is intensely produced by in­
flammatory cells, which can lead to cell damage. In this way, increased
CAT activity may indicate a protective antioxidant action on local cells.
This action was reinforced by the total antioxidant capacity, which was
increased in wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs during the inflam­
matory phase (3 days). Increased CAT activity and reduced ROS pro­
duction were previously demonstrated in allergic dermatitis induced by
lead oxide treated with ZnO-NPs at a concentration of 1% (Khalaf et al.,
2019).
It has also been shown that the interaction between CAT and the AgNP surface is strong enough to promote conformational changes in the
enzyme that can modify its enzymatic activity (Liu et al., 2020). The
ability of Ag-NPs to modulate the activity of catalase may have
contributed to the increase in the activity of this enzyme independently
of the response of its main sources: neutrophils, macrophages, and SOD
(activities that were not increased in this period). In addition to the
effects of Ag-NPs and ZnO-NPs already described, AgO-NPs may have
contributed to altering oxidative parameters due to their antioxidant
activities shown previously (Ravichandran et al., 2016). After 14 and 21
days of treatment, the inflammation was resolved (the main source of

healing, Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs could promote inflammatory and oxidative
changes. This treatment resulted in increases in collagen and MMPs and
was effective in regenerating epidermal attachments, such as hair fol­
licles and sebaceous glands, which are essential for the functional ac­
tivity of the skin (Baquerizo Nole and Kirsner, 2015; Prost-Squarcioni,
2006).
The healing process occurs in three stages which overlap and were
evaluated at different periods of our study: inflammation (1–4 days),
proliferation (3–14 days), and remodeling (8 days-1 or 2 years) (Maxson
et al., 2012). Inflammation is represented by an intense infiltration of
neutrophils and macrophages in the wound (Ellis et al., 2018). Once in
the wound, these cells eliminate debris and fight infections by removing
pathogens. To do this, neutrophils and macrophages secrete MMPs (Gill
and Parks, 2008), several pro-inflammatory cytokines (Goldman, 2004),
and large amounts of ROS (Hoffmann and Griffiths, 2018; Schäfer and
Werner, 2008). We demonstrated that the treatment of wounds with AgZnO/AgO NPs reduced the activity of both cells (neutrophils and mac­
rophages). The antibacterial activity of Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs on E. coli and
S. aureus, usually found in infected wounds, may be one factor that can
reduce the inflammatory process (Sousa, 2019; Usanga et al., 2020).
After performing their activities, the prolonged presence of these
cells, especially the neutrophils and their inflammatory mediators,
contributes to the formation and persistence of chronic wounds (Ellis
et al., 2018). The ability of Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs to reduce the activity of
inflammatory cells is demonstrated for the nanoparticles of Ag-NPs and
ZnO-NPs, and some mechanisms have been described for this action.
Among them, the ability of ZnO-NPs to suppress pro-inflammatory cy­
tokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-α) (Li et al., 2017), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by Ag-NPs have been
described (Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, infected and non-infected
wounds treated with Ag-NPs have reduced neutrophil and macrophage
activities (Chhibber et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2018b), while wounds
treated with ZnO-NPs had reduced neutrophil infiltration (Li et al.,
2017).

ROS during healing). Consequently, a decreased ability to eliminate ROS
in wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs was observed.
Wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs for 21 days increased CAT
activity and reduced SOD. These changes could result in a reduction in
H2O2 levels since this radical can be produced by SOD and eliminated by
CAT (Kurahashi and Fujii, 2015). H2O2 primarily acts in inflammation
and proliferation, in the debris and pathogen elimination, stimulation of
angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and to increase collagen (Was­
serbauer et al., 2008). Therefore, H2O2 levels after 21 days of treatment,
proliferative stage, may be required in a lower concentration, without
impairing the quality of the repair.
Lipids are the main targets of ROS. Lipids are the essential compo­
nents of cell membranes that maintain the structure and control the
function of cells (Yin et al., 2011). Wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO
NPs showed a reduction in lipoperoxidation, indicating better cell and
tissue preservation. These results are consistent with those observed for
individualized (ZnO-NPs and Ag-NPs) treatments (Chhibber et al., 2019;
Khalaf et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017). The antioxidant activity of Ag-ZnO/
AgO NPs added to the ability to reduce lipoperoxidation, demonstrating
its potential for improving the healing process, especially in the late
stages of proliferation and remodeling. In wounds of diabetic patients,
lipoperoxidation impairs collagen metabolism and damages ECM,
compromising the viability and migration of keratinocytes and fibro­
blasts, cells that are essential for the reconstruction of injured skin (Niki
et al., 1991; Silhi, 1998).
In latter repair phases, mast cells can affect collagen synthesis by
activating transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) via chymase protein
production (Oskeritzian, 2012). Thus, the increase in mast cell marking
found in wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs after 14 days of

treatment suggest a modulatory capacity for repairing skin wounds by
inducing changes in fibrogenesis and, consequently, increasing the total
collagen. Fibroblasts are fundamental cells in the proliferative process,
responsible for collagen production to restore ECM (Oskeritzian, 2012).
ZnO-NPs’ ability to increase collagen production is due to their ca­
pacity to induce metalloproteinases that can cleave pro-collagen mole­
cule peptides, a fundamental step in collagen synthesis (Lansdown et al.,
2007). Collagen is essential for the healing event, participate in cell
adhesion and cell migration, serve as support for tissues, and regulate
the function of resident cells (Xue and Jackson, 2015).
The quantification of collagen types I and III allows us to evaluate the
maturity of the formed tissue. The wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO
NPs showed an increase in the amount of both types of collagens.
Absence of these fibers after 7 days of treatment indicates that these
wounds are replaced in later periods. During the initial stages of gran­
ulation tissue formation, myofibroblasts deposit collagen III fibers which
determine the diameter of collagen fibril I (Hayakawa et al., 1979). As
healing progresses, the production of type I collagen is increased, while
type III collagen is reduced (Xue and Jackson, 2015).
We demonstrated that the treatment of wounds with the nano­
composite had no effect on angiogenesis. Wounds showed a maximum
peak for the formation of new vessels after 7 days of treatment,
consistent with the proliferative stage, when the angiogenesis usually
occurs (Cañedo-Dorantes and Cañedo-Ayala, 2019).
Similar to the activity of inflammatory cells and the oxidative
response, the activity of MMPs during the healing process must occur in
a balanced way. We demonstrated that wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/
AgO NPs present increased MMP-9 activity until the proliferation pro­
cess (3 and 7 days). On days 14 and 21, this activity was not observed.
13

MMP-9 is produced by keratinocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages,
and neutrophils (Xue and Jackson, 2015). This demonstrates that
although MMP-9 plays a role in healing, it is not prolonged in the later
stages of repair. MMP-9 has a fundamental role in the migration of
keratinocytes and fibroplasia. The increase of MMP-9 activity in wounds
treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs may have accelerated wound closure.
The importance of MMP-9 was demonstrated by suppressing this
enzyme in mice, which led to delayed re-epithelialization and reduced
collagen production, resulting in wounds with irregular ECM remodel­
ing (Kyriakides et al., 2009). Here, we observed that increased MMP-9
activity in wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/ AgO NPs occurred simulta­
neously with increased re-epithelialization and collagen synthesis.
The role of MMP-2 has been described in several tissue remodeling
studies (Itoh et al., 1997; Page-McCaw et al., 2007), probably due to its
production in fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Xue and Jackson, 2015).
Thus, the increase in MMP-2 in wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs,
especially after 21 days, demonstrated accelerated healing, with the
resolution of the previous stages (inflammation and proliferation) and
characteristics of the remodeling stage. The increase in reepithelialization and collagen in qualitative assays suggested healing
capabilities for the nanocomposite of ZnOAg-loaded chitosan (Lu et al.,
2017) and ZnOAg-NPs (Kantipudi et al., 2018).
Given our results, we suggest that events such as collagen deposition,
reduced inflammatory process, increased antioxidant defenses,
increased mast cells, and control over the activities of MMP-2 and MMP9 can contribute to the healing effects of Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs. We also
found that wounds treated with Ag-ZnO/AgO NPs showed structural and
functional improvement of the skin. This can be confirmed by the
reconstitution of fundamental attachments, such as hair follicles and
sebaceous glands. Although vehicle treatment was able to modulate
some stages of healing, it presented a negligible difference compared to
control.

6. Conclusion
The Ag-ZnO/ AgO NPs nanocomposite was effective in the treatment
of wounds. The healing process observed during this treatment was
accompanied by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses. The data
showed that Ag-ZnO/ AgO NPs promoted ECM repair due to their effects
on collagen production and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. In addition,
Ag-ZnO/ AgO NPs restored functional activity of the skin. These data are
in accordance with the properties reported for ZnO-NPs, Ag-NPs and
AgO-NPs and offer the potential for the topical use of the Ag-ZnO/ AgO
nanocomposite, as demonstrated by its promising biological activities in
wound healing and tissue repair.

ABSTRACT
The ZnO nanoparticles were prepared using Zinc acetate as a precursor by wet chemical method. The
particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, UV-vis spectroscopy and Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Woven (100%) medical cotton fabric was treated with nano ZnO based finish.
The antimicrobial property was assessed quantitatively with test method AATCC 100 against gram positive
and gram negative bacteria. The finished samples were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
Spectroscopy, and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The finished sample showed good antimicrobial
property showing 97.61% reduction for Staphylococcus aureus and 96.97% reduction for Klebsiella
pneumonia after 50 washes. The study indicates that nano ZnO based finish enhances antimicrobial
properties of cotton and hence can be used to treat fabric used for medical and hygiene apparel.

Introduction
Focus on antimicrobial properties in medical
textiles have increased more due to increasing
incidence of bacterial infections. To impart
antimicrobial properties, and to prevent the
exposure and transference of micro-organisms,
medical textiles have been coated with variety of
antimicrobial agents (Murugesh Babu and
Ravindra, 2014; Gao and Cranston, 2008). Of
these, inorganic antimicrobial agents are gaining
more importance for their increased stability at
high temperatures and pressures such as TiO2,
ZnO, MgO and CaO (Sawai, 2003; Stoimenov et
al., 2002). Nanoparticles of especially copper
oxide, Zinc oxide and nanosilver are known for
their antimicrobial effect.
Zinc oxide is known to have remarkable
properties like high thermal conductivity, high
refractive index, binding energy, UV protection
and antibacterial because of which it is
extensively used in biomedicine as anticancer,
drug delivery, antibacterial, and diabetes
treatment; anti-inflammation; wound healing;,
and bio imaging and other industries like
cosmetics, solar cells, rubber, concrete, food etc.
(Uikey and Vishwakarma, 2016; Jiang et al.,
2018). Currently nanosilver is being widely used
in most of the consumer products including
clothing and wound dressings. Silver however
causes toxicity and may possess potential
environmental problem (Bondarenko et al., 2013;
Prabhu and Poulose, 2012; Ray et al., 2009;
Mishra et al., 2017; Zhang and Xiong, 2015;
Kim et al., 2017; Xiong, 2013). ZnO
nanoparticles have been found to be nontoxic
with good compatibility to human cells (Zvyagin
et al., 2008; Kachynski et al., 2008; Vanheusden
et al., 1996). They are receiving more preference
due to cost effectiveness and white appearance in
comparison to nano silver and other metal oxide
nano particles (Kathirvelu et al., 2010). Also
ZnO is found to be chemically stable at higher
temperatures and UV (Becheri et al., 2007).
Recently it is being explored to be used for

textile applications. They can be better
alternative to triclosan, quaternary ammonium
salts, and other synthetic organic compounds that
are dominating the market of antimicrobial
textiles (Perelshtein et al., 2016).
Zinc is also an essential element for body tissues
and enzyme systems and has an important role in
body metabolism, proteins and nucleic acid
synthesis, hematopoiesis, and neurogenesis.
Moreover, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has indexed it as GRAS (generally
recognized as safe) (Jiang et al., 2018;
Rasmussen et al., 2010).
With exceptional properties, various methods are
being explored to synthesize ZnO. Different
methods produce different morphologies and size
with unique properties and applications (Gupta et
al., 2007). The nanostructures can be produced
by variety of physical and chemical methods
such as nanolithography, physical vapour
deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition,
spray conversion processing, sol-gel process, and
precipitation method however size and shape of
nanoparticle can be better controlled by chemical
techniques(Sirelkhatim et al., 2015; Belay et al.,
2017). Most of the synthesis techniques require
either high temperature or high vacuum. In this
study, Zinc oxide nanoparticles were produced
by a chemical reduction method which is
inexpensive,
requires
low
temperature,
reproducible and environmental friendly (Borade
et al., 2016).
It has been discovered in many studies that
particle size and concentration of nanoparticle
play an important role for antimicrobial activity
(Sirelkhatim et al., 2015). Submicron sized
particles of ZnO react with water to produce
reactive oxygen species that destroy the bacteria
cell membranes. And, if the size of nanoparticles
is made even smaller, the result will be more
effective as the particles will reach inside the
bacterial cell wall resulting in even higher killing
efficiency (Anita and Ramachandran, 2012).The
present work is an attempt to investigate the
2

antimicrobial effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles
and to find optimum of ZnO concentration to
effectively combat bacteria.
Materials and Methodology
Materials
100% medical cotton fabric (Twill weave, GSM204g/m2, EPI-120, PPI-60 warp count-25 tex and
weft count-27 tex) was used for the study. Before
application, the fabric samples were washed in
distilled water to remove impurities. Zinc acetate
was purchased from Merck. Sodium Hydroxide
and PVA was procured from S. D. Fine
Chemicals, 99%.
Preparation of zinc oxide nanoparticles
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared by wet
chemical method. 2M NaOH was dissolved in 20
ml of deionized water and 0.1M Zinc acetate was
dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water. NaOH
solution was added dropwise into zinc acetate
solution to adjust the pH of solution to 7 under
constant stirring. The reaction was continued for
2 hours at 80˚C after the addition of NaOH. The
solution was then allowed to settle and
supernatant solution was discarded carefully. The
obtained nanoparticles were rinsed several times
by ethanol, DI water and finally dehydrated at
100˚C for 2 Hrs in ambient conditions.
Characterization of ZnO particles
The XRD of ZnO particles was performed using
ShimadzuXRD-6100 X-ray diffractometer using
Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation over a range from
20 to 80 2θ angles to study the crystalline
structure of the sample.The UV-Vis absorbance
spectra of the sample dispersed in DI water was
recorded within 200–600 nm wavelength range,
using a ShimadzuUV -1800 ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer.The shape of the nano
particles were obtained through TEM, using a
FEI Technai G2 apparatus operating at 300kv.
Application of zinc oxide nanoparticles on fabric
Zinc Oxide nanoparticles were applied on
medical cotton fabric using pad-dry-cure method.
The solution was prepared by mixing ZnO
nanoparticles (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.25%)

along with PVA (2%) in shaker bath for 5
minutes. The cotton fabric samples were then
immersed in the solutions for 5 minutes and
passed through a padding mangle. The pressure
and speed of padding mangle was adjusted to get
approx. 100 % wet pickup for the treatments at
four different concentrations. The padded fabric
samples were then dried and cured for 3 mins at
140˚C.
Assessment of fabric treated with nano ZnO for
antimicrobial activity
The fabrics coated with zinc oxide nanoparticles
under different concentrations of nanoparticles
namely 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.25% were
tested quantitatively by a colony count method
by
following
AATCC
100
norms.
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), a Grampositive organism and Klebsiella pneumonia
(ATCC 4352) a Gram-negative organism were
used as test organisms respectively. Treated
sterilized and control samples of 4.8 cm ± 0.1 cm
were inoculated with the test organisms. After
inoculation, 100 ml of neutralizing solution was
added to the bottles containing both the test and
control swatches. The bottles were shaken
vigorously for 1 min and serial dilutions were
made with water followed by standard plate
count method in duplicate using nutrient agar.
The plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37˚C
and the bacterial colonies were counted using
colony counter. The antimicrobial activity was
evaluated by comparing the percent reduction of
bacteria in control and treated samples. The
percent reduction of bacteria (R) was calculated
using the following formula:
R (%) = (B – A) x 100/ B
Where R = % reduction; A = the number of
bacteria recovered from the inoculated treated
test specimen swatches in the bottle incubated
over the desired contact period; B = the number
of bacteria recovered from the inoculated treated
test specimen swatches in the bottle immediately
after inoculation. The treated fabric showing
maximum antibacterial activity was subjected to

Table 1: Antibacterial activity of fabric samples treated with nano and bulk ZnO

It can be observed from Figure 4, that fabric
samples treated with concentrations 0.10 and
0.25 showed almost 100% antimicrobial activity
whereas samples treated with 0.01 and 0.05
concentration showed less than 100% activity.

similar results reported in Zhang et al., 2009
where nano-sized and micron-sized ZnO
suspensions were found to be active in inhibiting
the bacteria growth although nanosized were to
be more effective than micro sized.

It is seen that with increase in concentration of
nano ZnO from 0.05, the inhibition percentage
remains more or less in same range against both
Staphylococcus
aureus
and
Klebsiella
pneumoniae. From the results, nano-ZnO coating
with 0.10% uptake of ZnO showed excellent
antibacterial activity (reduction > 99.99%), even
better than bulk ZnO.
The treated fabric was also subjected to wash

sustained antimicrobial activity until 50 washes
as shown in Table 2.The results correspond to

Zinc ions released from nano Zinc Oxide and
abrasive surface of ZnO are also suggested as
possible mechanisms for antimicrobial function.
Zinc ions released can cause bacterial cell
membrane disintegration, membrane protein
damage, and genomic instability, resulting in the
death of bacterial cells (McCarthy et al., 1992;
Jiang et al., 2018). The surface roughness of ZnO
particles causes the damage of cell membrane E
coli (Padmavathy and Vijayaraghavan, 2008).
ZnO particles are more active against gram
negative bacteria than gram positive. The
negative charge on cell wall of gram negative
bacteria leads to intense electrostatic interaction
with Zn ions on bacterial surface which blocks or
inhibits the bacteria in lag phase itself (Shaban et
al., 2018).
The exact antimicrobial mechanism is still not
well established although its considered to be
promising antimicrobial agent against different
bacterial species which can be coated on various

substrates to prevent bacteria from adhering,
spreading, and breeding in medical devices
(Jiang et al., 2018).
Characterization of nano finished fabric using
FTIR and SEM
3.2.1 Analysis of Zinc oxide finished fabrics
using FTIR
FTIR analysis technique was used to recognize
the materials chemical bonding. It is used to
identify the elemental constituents of a material.
Typically, cellulosic materials show two main
absorbance regions in IR spectrum. The first one
at low wavenumbers in the range 700 − 1800
cm−1, and the second one at higher wavenumbers
in range 2700 − 3500 cm−1.The characteristic
peaks exhibited by FTIR spectrum of zinc oxide
nanoparticles treated fabric was investigated in
Figure 6.Peaks were observed at wavelength
3277.66, 2887.14, 2361.99, 1704.19, 1240.24,
1014.21, 714.14, 660.89, 513.21, 484.28, 469.82,
464.68, 447.37 and 440.01 for the treated fabric.
Absorption band at 3277.66 illustrates
characteristics of OH functional groups in
cellulose. The peaks located at around 3237–
3410 cm−1 is due to the O–H stretching of the
hydroxyl groups of –Zn (OH)2and/or physically
adsorbed water molecules (Ghotbi, 2010).

generated by ZnO particles could be possible
mechanism for antimicrobial action (Sawai et al.,
1996; Yamamoto et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,
2006). UV or visible light activates ZnO
generating electron-hole pairs (e−h+). These
electrons /holes split H2O molecules into OH−
and H+ present in suspension of ZnO. Electrons
reduce dissolved oxygen to superoxide (•O2−)
which react with H+ to generate (HO2•) radicals.
These radicals produce hydrogen peroxide anions
(HO2−) after subsequent collision with electrons.
The peroxide ions then react with hydrogen ions
to produce molecules of H2O2 which can
penetrate the bacterial cell wall and kill the
bacteria.

to carboxylic acid due to oxidation of primary
hydroxyl sites. The peaks at 1704.19, 1240.24,
1014.21 belong to –C=O stretching.
The absorbance bands of zinc oxide lie between
400-700 indicating the presence of Zn-O
vibrational modes confirmed by characteristic
peaks at 469 and 484 (Shaban et al., 2018;
Vigneshwaran et al., 2006; Rajagopalan and
Khanna, 2013).
3.2.2 Analysis of Zinc oxide finished fabrics
using scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
The surface observation of zinc oxide
nanoparticle-ﬁnished fabric was carried out with
a
scanning
electron
microscope.
The
observations in Figure 7 revealed that the size of
the zinc oxide NPs coated on the fabric were in
the range between 200-600 nm and distributed.
The untreated cotton fabric seems to have
smooth fibers without any particles as seen in
Figure 7, while the cotton fabric treated with
ZnO nanoparticles showed deposition on surface.
In some areas agglomerates of the particles are

antimicrobial activity. The results show excellent
antimicrobial activity when treated with 0.1% of
nanoparticles against gram positive and gram
negative bacteria. The durability of finished
fabric was found to be excellent as it was able to
withstand 50 washes with 97.61% reduction for
Staphylococcus aureus and 96.97% reduction for
Klebsiella pneumonia. The FTIR results
indicated the presence of Zn-O vibrational modes
in treated fabric. The SEM results indicate the
deposition of particles with size ranging from
200nm to 500nm. Nano ZnO which is cost
effective and nontoxic can be of immense use in
medical textiles for their antimicrobial
functionality.

Abstract. The government of Indonesia has launched a program of ‘Making Indonesia 4.0’ since
April 4th 2018. The program is an integrated roadmap to implement a number of strategic action
to enter the 4.0 Industrial era. One of the strategic initiatives is the development of functional
clothing by producing a cloth that has multifunctional properties, such as antibacterial clothing.
Batik, a traditional cloth is originally from Indonesia. It is fabricated by applying hot wax onto
a fabric to create a pattern before colouring process which is then removed in the final stage.
Since people use batik in daily life for clothing and household appliances, it is worth to produce
antibacterial batik. This research aimed to make antibacterial batik by applying zinc oxide (ZnO)
nanoparticles to the material of batik i.e. cotton. Colouring process was conducted by synthetic
dyes of indigosol. To see the effect of ZnO application, the antibacterial activity, the colour
fastness to washing, the colour strength (K/S) and surface morphology of batik have been
examined. The results showed that the batik exhibited antibacterial activity due to the
incorporation of ZnO onto the fabric. The colour strength was also enhanced. To maintain the
colour fastness to washing, the ZnO should be applied to the fabric before the batik process.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that emphasizes on interconnectivity,
automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Indonesia has launched a program of ‘Making
Indonesia 4.0’ since April 4th 2018. The program is an integrated roadmap to implement a number of
strategic action to enter the 4.0 Industrial era. Five industrial sectors that have been selected for Making
Indonesia 4.0 are: Food and beverages, textile and apparel, automotive, electronics and chemicals. In
the textile and apparel sectors, Indonesia is targeted to become a leader of functional clothing producer
in 2030. Functional clothing exhibits multi-functional properties, including hydrophobicity, enhanced
thermal stability, antibacterial, UV-protection, anti-wetting and laundering performance [1].
In recent years, nanotechnology has become one of the most important and exciting fields in
chemistry, physics, biology and engineering [1]. Nanotechnology deals with particles at the atomic level
(1–100 nm). Structures on this scale have been shown to have unique and novel functional properties.
Nano materials in various forms such as metal nanoparticles, nano composites and metal oxides have
been used for functional finishing of textiles, such as UV protection, conductive, water repellent,
antibacterial, and deodorizing functionalization of textiles [2]. They can be applied onto textile surfaces
by different means like in situ synthesis, spraying and pad-dry-cure method. One of the most studied

nanoparticles is zinc oxide (ZnO). Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are preferred because of their unique
properties such as electrical, photo catalytic, optical, and antibacterial [3]. The antibacterial properties
of ZnO are excellent because they are heat-resistant and stable in a harsh conditions [4]. ZnO exhibits
significant antimicrobial activities when particle size is reduced to the nano meter range. The nano-sized
ZnO can interact with bacterial surface where it enters inside the cell, and subsequently exhibits distinct
bactericidal mechanisms [5]. Different methods have been adopted for investigation of antibacterial
activity. The agar diffusion method is the most frequently used method and has been standardized as an
official method for detecting bacteriostatic activity by the American Association of Textile Chemists
and Colourists (ATCC).
Batik is a traditional Indonesian cloth that have been recognized by UNESCO as the Intangible
Cultural Heritage of Humanity on October 2, 2009. According to SNI 0239: 2014, the term batik is a
handicraft as a result of resist dyeing technique using a hot wax that attached onto media (textile or nontextile) using the batik stamp (called a canting) [6]. The fabrics commonly used for batik are silk and
cotton. Cotton fabric has several advantages including high absorption, smooth and comfortable to wear
[7]. However, they certainly lack easy-care, dimensional stability, antibacterial, UV-blocking and selfcleaning properties [8]. Application of ZnO nanoparticles on cotton fabrics is expected to improve batik
performance, especially providing antibacterial properties. The process of batik fabrication is carried
out by attaching a hot wax onto fabric, which acts as a color barrier using a batik canting. Then the
dyeing process may be carried out by natural dyes or synthetic dyes. Furthermore, the wax is removed
by boiling the cloth in water. The batik cloth is then washed thoroughly and dried in the shade place [9].
The application of zinc oxide onto the fabric is not only able to provide antibacterial properties but
also improve its coloring quality. These have been investigated by a number of researchers [8] [10].
Cotton fabrics that have previously been carboxymethylated and then applied using zinc oxide and
titanium isopropoxide have good antimicrobial properties and color fastness [8]. Tavanaie (2017)
applies ZnO-TiO2-PET (Polyethylene Tereptalat) to the fabric and has excellent color absorption and
color fastness [10]. To the best of author knowledge, there has been no research yet about application
of ZnO nanoparticles for producing antibacterial batik, therefore this research was conducted to apply
ZnO nanoparticles for producing antibacterial batik with good coloring quality.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and Equipments
Batik wax, cotton fabric, synthetic dye of Indigosol, aluminium sulphate (Al(SO4)2·12H2O), non-ionic
detergents (TRO), soda ash (NaCO3), natrium nitrit (NaNO2), and HCl were purchased from Prawoto
Shop, Yogyakarta. ZnO nanoparticles powder (average particle size of 67 nm) was obtained from Sigma
Aldrich. Analytical balance (Fujitsu), oven (Memmert), magnetic stirrer (SCILOGEX MS7-H550-Pro)
and standard laboratory glassware were used for the experimentation. The experiments were carried out
at the laboratory of Centre for Craft and Batik Yogyakarta.
2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Making the batik. The batik processes includes an application of the batik wax onto fabric, dyeing
process and removal of the wax. Initially, the white cotton fabric was immersed in a non-ionic detergent
(TRO) solution (0.1%) in order to clean it up. To apply the batik wax onto fabric, the melted wax was
applied onto the fabric by batik stamp to create desired pattern. The dyeing process was carried out by
the following procedures: the indigosol dye solution was prepared by dissolving 5 g/l of dyes with 10
g/l of NaNO2. Dyeing of the fabric was conducted by immersing the fabric in the indigosol solution for
5 minutes and then it was dried under sun light for 10 minutes. The dyeing process was repeated twice.
Then the fabric was immersed in the acid solution (15 cm 3/l of HCl) and it was neutralized with soda
ash solution (1 gr/l of Na2CO3). At last the fabric was rinsed thoroughly in tap water and exposed to the

sun to get dried. To remove the wax, fabrics was immersed in the boiling water until the wax was
removed. Soda ash (2 gr/l) was added in the water to help removing the wax.
2.2.2. Application of ZnO nanoparticles onto fabric. ZnO nanoparticles was applied onto the fabric by
the pad-dry-cure method. To investigate the effect of ZnO concentration, temperature and order of the
ZnO application, the research was carried out at a concentration of ZnO of 1% and 2%, temperature of
25oC and 80oC and the coating of ZnO conducted before and after the batik process. Initially, the fabric
was immersed in a non-ionic detergent (TRO) solution (0.1%) in order to clean it up. Thereafter ZnO
was applied to the fabric using the pad-dry-cure method. When it was applied before the batik process,
white cotton fabric (330 mm x 350 mm) was dipped into ZnO solution (1% and 2%) at the temperature
variation of 25oC and 80oC. The cotton fabric was then padded at room temperature to reduce moisture
content. Afterward the fabric was dried at 80oC for 5 minutes. The dipping-padding-drying processes
were repeated 3 times. Then the fabric was cured at 140oC for 3 minutes. The batik process was then
subsequently carried out. When ZnO was applied after the batik process, the batik process was carried
out first and then followed by the application of ZnO using the same procedures.
2.3. Characterizations
2.3.1. Antibacterial Activity. Antibacterial activity of the ZnO coated fabric was examined against
Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Eschericia coli using agar
diffusion method. The bacteria were prepared in nutrient broth medium. Test organisms diluted x100
from a 3 hour culture, were wiped on the surface of Isosensitest agar plates. The batik of 15 mm diameter
were then slightly pressed on to the surface of one plate and the control fabric was onto another plate.
The incubation of the plates were carried out at 37°C for 18 – 24 hours. The antibacterial activity of
batik was indicated by the inhibition zone diameter (mm) compared to the control fabric [7].
2.3.2. Colour Strength. Color strength (K/S value). Color strength of the batik were evaluated using a
UV-vis Spectrometer. The reflectance (R) of the samples were measured so the K/S value were
calculated using equation 1. The K/S value indicates the color intensity of dyed samples [8].

2.3.3. Color fastness to washing. Washing fastness was carried out in accordance to ISO 105-C10:2006
standard. The change in color and stains of the adjacent batik were assessed by grey scale.
3. Result and Discussion
Antibacterial activity of white fabric and batik with ZnO treatment have been examined using the agar
plate method. The results are shown in Figure 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows inhibition zone around the sample
fabric of white fabric and batik with ZnO treatment against E.coli bacteria compared to antibacterial
drug (Chloramphenicol) and batik without ZnO treatment. Figure 2 shows inhibition zone of the same
sample against S. aureus bacteria. As can be seen in Figure 1, ZnO application affect the ability of the
fabric to inhibit the growth of E. coli bacteria, since the value of inhibition area of fabric without ZnO
is zero. The inhibition area of coated fabric is approximately 60% of inhibition zone of the antibacterial
drug (Chloramphenicol). The treated white fabric exhibit slightly greater antibacterial effect than the
treated batik. This indicates that the batik process reduce slightly the antibacterial activity against E. coli
of the treated fabric. The order of ZnO treatment (before and after the batik process), the difference of
ZnO concentration and temperature did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity against E. coli
bacteria.

The same trend of antibacterial activity is shown by the sample fabric against S. aureus as can be seen
in Figure 2. The inhibition area of coated fabric against S. aureus bacteria is approximately 60% - 75%
of inhibition zone of the antibacterial drug (Chloramphenicol), slightly greater than the inhibition zone
against E. coli bacteria. This is in line with the study of some researchers which state that gram-negative
E. coli bacteria are more resistant to the antibacterial activity of ZnO compared to gram-positive S. aureus
bacteria [4][12][9]. In this case the effect of temperature, concentration of ZnO solution and the order of
ZnO treatment are also insignificant. Even though the effect of the ZnO application order is insignificant,
there was a slight decrease of antibacterial activity against both E. coli and S. aureus when ZnO was
applied before the batik process. This is due to the batik process, mainly dyeing and wax removal process.
The dyeing and wax removal process caused the ZnO separated from the fabric thus providing less
antibacterial activity. The mechanism of antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles was studied by

Mishra which states that ZnO nanoparticles can generate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) that damage
bacterial membranes, DNA, and mitochondria, resulting in the death of bacterial cells [13].
The inhibition area due to the effect of ZnO application were photographed and shown in Figure 3
and 4. In Figure 3b, the white cotton cloth applied by ZnO shows the zone of inhibition around the fabric.
Whereas the zone of inhibition not seen in Figure 3a, indicates no antibacterial activity on the untreated
white fabric. This result corresponds with Rajendran’s study on producing antimicrobial cotton fabric
using ZnO nanoparticles [11]. Figure 4b also shows the zone of inhibition of the batik fabric applied by
ZnO whereas there is no inhibition area around the untreated batik fabric in Figure 4a. It can be seen that
the zone of inhibition of treated batik is smaller than the zone of inhibition of white fabric applied by
ZnO, indicates that the process of batik causes a decrease in antibacterial activity of the fabric, due to the
reduction of ZnO during the batik process.

The assessment of surface morphology by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) shows the presence
of ZnO nanoparticles on the fabric. Figure 5 shows that the ZnO nanoparticles were imparted on the white
fabric before being applied with wax (batik process). Figure 6 shows the presence of ZnO nanoparticles
on the fabric after the batik process. It can be seen that ZnO in the fabric after the batik process is less
than in the white fabric. This shows the ZnO loss during the batik process. But from the assessment of
antibacterial activity previously discussed, although there is a reduction of ZnO during the batik process,
the batik fabric still exhibit antibacterial activity. This indicates that ZnO nanoparticles is suitable for
producing antibacterial batik, and the proof of Dimapilis’s study which states that the antibacterial
properties of ZnO is excellent because they are heat-resistant and stable in a harsh conditions [4].

Figure 5. Morphology of ZnO-treated white fabrics before the batik process

Figure 6. Morphology of ZnO-treated batik fabric
The assessment of colour strength and washing fastness of ZnO-treated batik fabric is seen in Table
1. The colour strength is shown by the K/S value that indicates the colour intensity of the dyed fabric,
calculated using equation 1. In all ZnO-treated batik fabrics gives a K/S value that are greater than the
batik fabric without ZnO application. The higher K/S value indicates a high intensity of the colour. The
higher K/S values of ZnO-treated batik fabric indicate that the presence of ZnO nanoparticles increases
the dye affinity towards the fabric[12]. When ZnO was applied after the batik process, the K/S value is
higher, but the colour fastness to washing value is lower than untreated batik fabric. Meanwhile, when
ZnO was applied before the batik process, the value of colour fastness to washing is the same as untreated
batik fabric and the K/S values are still higher than untreated batik fabric. So to increase the K/S value
and to maintain colour fastness to washing, ZnO application should be carried out before the batik
process.

4. Conclusions
The ZnO application can provide antibacterial activity of synthetic dye batik against E. coli and S. aureus.
The antibacterial activity of treated batik fabric against S. aureus is greater than that against E.coli. The
order of ZnO treatment (before and after the batik process), the difference of ZnO concentration and
temperature did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of batik fabric against E. coli and S.
aureus bacteria. However, there was a slight decrease of antibacterial activity against both E. coli and S.
aureus when ZnO was applied before the batik process. This is due to the batik process, mainly dyeing
and wax removal process that caused the ZnO separated from the fabric thus providing less antibacterial
activity. The ZnO application also enhance color strength that indicate the presence of ZnO nanoparticles
increases the dye affinity towards the fabrics. To maintain the value of color fastness to washing, the ZnO
application should be carried out before the batik process.

Hospital fabrics are commonly exposed to multiple patients and contaminated
surfaces between washing/sterilization cycles. Consequently, these textiles act
as vectors for the spread of diseases, especially bacterial pathogens. Many
modification schemes have been proposed to mitigate the growth and spread of
bacteria on fabrics, including use of antimicrobial metal oxide nanoparticles.
The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of conformal nanoscale
ZnO coatings applied to cotton fabrics via atomic layer deposition to control
bacterial spread. We find that, at low ZnO loading fractions, bacteria metabolize Zn2+ ions and reproduce more rapidly. However, as the ZnO loading is
increased, the higher concentrations of Zn2+ overwhelm the bacteria and the
nanocoatings become effective antibacterial treatments, killing all bacteria
present. These results map out an important design space for implementing
ZnO coatings as a potential antimicrobial treatment for textiles and other
surfaces.

INTRODUCTION
Textiles are ubiquitous in modern life. Humans
encounter textiles daily in their clothing, linens,
and upholstery. In the healthcare industry, this
ubiquity can make textiles a dangerous vector for
the spread of disease.1 The contribution of textiles to
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is a growing
concern. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), HAIs are defined
as infections caused by invasive devices and procedures used on patients during the processes of
treatment and recovery;2 they are a major health
and financial issue, as they can increase patient
mortality rates, length of hospital/healthcare facility stays, and medical costs.3,4 While nosocomial

Renee U. Puvvada and Jamie P. Wooding have contributed equally to this
work.

infections are commonly caused by medical devices
including catheters and ventilators, healthcare textiles to which patients are exposed during procedures and recovery, such as curtains, white coats,
and scrubs, can exhibit pathogenic and bacterial
contamination that can be passed between healthcare workers and patients.1,4–7 As such, there is a
growing need in the healthcare industry for antibacterial fabrics to reduce risks associated with crosscontamination and transmission of pathogens.1,3
Inorganic metal oxides, including ZnO, MgO, and
CaO, have demonstrated antibacterial activity
against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus
aureus.8,9 The antibacterial activity of these metal
oxides is believed to be a consequence of their
dissolution into metal ions, which can be cytotoxic to
bacteria. These metal ions (Zn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+)
are also essential for enzymatic activity and gene

expression in many bacteria, but when delivered in
excess, they can overwhelm the bacteria, cause
growth inhibition, and lead to cell death.10–13
Previously, inorganic metal oxides have been
incorporated as antibacterial agents in fabrics via
sol–gel,14–16 wet chemical (aqueous),17,18 spray
pyrolysis,19–21 electrodeposition,22,23 and hydrothermal methods.24,25 The aim of this work is to study
how bacteria interact with fabrics conformally
coated with nanoscale ZnO thin films via atomic
layer deposition (ALD). As reported by Hyde
et al.,26,27 and Lee et al.,28 ALD enables vaporphase precursors to penetrate and coat complex
fiber structures in a conformal and uniform fashion
to alter surface properties of the substrate. As such,
we leverage the conformality and deposition precision unique to the ALD process to systematically
control the thickness of the ZnO coating on cotton
fabrics from 0.2 nm to 20 nm and to study the
variation in the bacterial response with the extent
of ZnO loading. We find that, for low loading levels,
it is possible to increase bacterial growth, while
higher loading fractions achieve the more desirable,
antibacterial effects.
METHODS
Materials
Single-fill plain-weave 100% cotton fabrics were
purchased from Mybecca, Inc. (Los Angeles, CA,
USA), and used as received. Prior to use, material
was stored at approximately 24C and 20% relative
humidity. Fabrics were exposed to DH5-a strain of
E. coli, a strain commonly utilized for laboratory
processes to assess the antibacterial response of a
substance.
Atomic Layer Deposition
Woven cotton fabrics were conformally coated
with ZnO films using ALD. ALD is a well-established thin-film deposition technique in which vapor
phase-precursors are sequentially delivered to a
substrate and undergo self-limiting surface reactions, depositing a film ‘‘atomic-layer-by-atomiclayer.’’29,30 In this work, ZnO ALD was conducted
in a custom-built, hot-walled, flow-tube reactor (4
in. inner diameter) under continuous flow of N2
carrier gas at 2 Torr and temperature of 90C.
Fabrics were held at 90C in the 2 Torr flowing
nitrogen atmosphere for 10 min prior to deposition
to reduce the amount of adsorbed water. Diethylzinc
[DEZ, 95% purity, Zn(C2H5)2] from Strem Chemicals (Newburyport, MA, USA) and deionized (DI)
water were used as ALD precursors with dosing
sequence of 1.0 s DEZ dose/45 s N2 purge/1.0 s H2O
dose/60 s N2 purge, controlled using a custom LabVIEW programming environment.31 Cotton fabrics
were coated with 1–100 cycles of this DEZ/H2O
sequence, corresponding to approximately 0.2–
20 nm of ZnO. The ZnO coating thickness on the

cotton fabrics was estimated based on film thickness
measurements performed on Si wafers, present as
monitor wafers in the deposition chamber, via
spectroscopic ellipsometry (alpha-SE, J.A. Woollam
Co., Lincoln, NE, USA) and are consistent with
reported growth rates on SiO2 surfaces at low
temperatures.32,33
Chemical and Structural Analysis
Fiber and film microstructure were studied via
optical microscopy (Leica DVM6 Digital Microscope,
Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Phenom ProX
SEM, Phenom World, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). To study the coating conformality and
continuity, 100-cycle ZnO-coated cotton fabrics
underwent 650C heat treatment in air for 4 h to
burn out (pyrolyze) the cotton fabrics such that the
remaining ZnO structure could be imaged. Energydispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to
analyze the spatial arrangements of the elemental
composition of the treated and untreated fabrics. All
EDX measurements were carried out at electron
beam accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; PerkinElmer TGA 4000,
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was performed
to determine the weight percent of ZnO on the
cotton fabrics post-ALD treatment. A standard TGA
run consisted of holding 5 mg of fabric in a ceramic
sample pan at 110C for 60 min to remove water,
then ramping the temperature from 110C to 900C
at 10C/min in air. This temperature range is
sufficient to completely combust the cotton fabric.34
At least three replicates of each cotton fabric
treatment were analyzed, in addition to a set of
replicates of the empty ceramic crucible to correct
collected data for buoyancy effects. Inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES; Optima 7300DV, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) was performed to detect chemical elements
present. A 1 cm 9 1 cm fabric square was placed in
125 lL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for
20 h, and the solution was sampled to determine the
concentration of Zn.
Bacterial Viability Studies
Bacterial growth on both treated and untreated
fabrics was studied in both aqueous and pseudo-dry
conditions. Prior to the start of all bacterial studies,
fabrics were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light
(60 Hz, 40 lW/cm2) for 15 min to kill any native
bacteria. Because this UV light exposure is for a
short period of time, it should not cause significant
chemical degradation within the cotton fabric,35
especially since ZnO coatings have been found to
impart UV protection.36 In the initial study, fabric
was exposed to bacteria in aqueous conditions. A
1 cm 9 1 cm fabric square was placed in a 115-lL
aliquot of PBS containing 10 lL of 5 9 1011 bacteria/
liter of DH5-a E. coli, as determined by OD600. The

Bacterial Growth and Death on Cotton Fabrics Conformally Coated with ZnO Thin Films of
Varying Thicknesses via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)

fabric was incubated in this solution for 20 h. The
bacterial solution was then sampled via pipetting and
underwent six tenfold dilutions as appropriate before
plating on an agar plate (LB Agar, Fisher BioReagents, Miller, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). This concentration of bacteria corresponds to American Association
of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) TM100
protocol and is the same across all experiments;37
furthermore, bacteria growth was found to be in the
log phase during incubation. After culturing the
bacteria for 20 h in an incubator (VWR 1535 Incubator, VWR Scientific, Radnor, PA, USA) at 37C,
colony-forming units (CFUs) were visually counted to
quantify the concentration of viable bacteria remaining in solution (Supplementary Fig. S-1).
A second method for bacterial growth was undertaken to better approximate the pseudo-dry conditions typically encountered during fabric use. This
method is derived from AATCC TM100 protocol.37
Again, prior to testing, all fabrics were sterilized with
UV light for 15 min. Three 48-mm-diameter circular
swatches of fabric were then exposed to 1 mL of 100
bacteria/liter concentration bacterial solution, just
enough to completely wet all fibers in the fabric.
Exposure times between 5 s and 100,000 s (approximately 1 day) were explored. During exposure,
fabrics were kept in a sealable sterile 120-mL plastic
container to maintain a constant level of ‘‘wetness.’’
After the designated exposure time, fabrics were

transferred to an empty, sterile 120-mL plastic
container with 100 mL PBS solution. The container
was then agitated by hand for 1 min to collect any
bacteria present. The PBS solution was then sampled, diluted appropriately, plated on agar growth
media, and incubated at 37C for 20 h (Supplementary Fig. S-2). The number of CFUs was then
counted and averaged across six experiments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 summarizes the electron microscopy
investigation of the ALD ZnO-coated cotton fabrics.
The base cotton fabric has a weave structure with
yarn diameter of approximately 150–250 lm and
individual fiber diameter ranging from 10 lm to
20 lm (Fig. 1a). Because the organometallic ALD
precursor, DEZ, is highly reactive towards water,
we expect the precursor to readily react with the six
hydroxyl groups per monomer unit of cellulose,27,38
quickly nucleating and creating a conformal metal
oxide coating on the cotton fabric. After 100 cycles,
the ZnO coating was easily detectable by EDX
(Fig. 1b). To further understand the structure of
this coating, we burned out (pyrolyzed) the cotton at
650C in air. Based on the TGA analysis, these
conditions were sufficient to fully remove all the
cotton (Supplementary Fig. S-5). Figure 1c presents
the results of SEM/EDX analysis of these pyrolyzed

fabrics, clearly showing hollow tubes of ZnO, which
appear ‘‘transparent’’ in SEM, consistent with this
ZnO ALD layer originally being conformal to the
cotton fibers. In fact, the entire woven structure was
maintained, although the yarn diameters shrank
to  100 lm and the fiber diameters to less than
10 lm. EDX spectra showed a marked decrease in
carbon signal after pyrolysis, further verifying the
removal of cotton, and a marked increase in the Zn
signal since the electron beam is now sampling more
ZnO fibers and the ZnO fibers have densified. This
ability to use ALD to replicate the macro- and
microscale structure of cotton fibers is consistent
with the previous report by Hojo et al.39
To better quantify the ZnO loading on the cotton
fabrics, treated fabrics were examined by thermogravimetric analysis. Residual ZnO mass loadings
detected via TGA for cotton fabrics coated with 1–
100 ALD cycles are summarized in Fig. 2. As
expected, the ZnO mass loading increased reasonably linearly with the ALD cycle number. Below 30
ALD cycles, ZnO was undetectable by TGA. Cotton
fabrics coated with 100 cycles of ZnO ALD had an
average loading of 3.8 wt.% ZnO. This loading
dropped to 1.5 wt.% at 50 cycles. Supplementary
Table S-I provides complete numerical values for
each of these measurements.
We next examined the bacterial growth on fabrics
with ZnO films of varying thicknesses fully
immersed in aqueous dispersions of E. coli. Figure 3 plots the average number of colony-forming
units (CFUs) observed for a variety of ZnO film
thicknesses as well as for three controls. The error
bars in this figure represent the standard error for
three trials. Three control conditions were included
in this study: (1) bacteria in PBS without fabric
(positive control), (2) bacteria in PBS with a swatch
of untreated cotton fabric, and (3) bacteria in
ethanol (negative control). For the positive control
(cells only), we measured 19.7 CFUs of E. coli per
115 lL PBS. When cotton fabric was added to the

bacterial PBS solution, we observed a 50% increase
in the average number of bacteria present. As such,
we are in agreement with Selvam et al.40 in
concluding that untreated cotton fabric does not
exhibit antibacterial properties. Interestingly, a
statistically significant increase in bacterial growth
was observed for cotton fabrics coated with 1, 3, and
10 cycles of ZnO ALD. At 10 cycles of ZnO ALD, the
bacterial growth increased by more than five times
compared with the positive control. In this regime,
we propose that ZnO is dissolving and the Zn2+ ions
are acting as a nutrient for bacterial
growth.9,11,13,41,42 In contrast, as the number of
cycles was increased to over 50 (coating thickness
approximately 10 nm), bacterial growth was significantly suppressed; cotton fabrics coated with 100
cycles of ZnO ALD consistently showed no bacterial
growth in PBS solution. At these ZnO loadings, the
Zn2+ ion concentration appears cytotoxic towards
E. coli.9,12,42
While the exact mechanism of the interaction of
nano-ZnO with bacterial species is generally not
agreed upon,9,42 Espitia et al.9 delineate three main
reported mechanisms for the antibacterial activity
of metal oxides: (1) release of antibacterial ions, (2)
interaction of nanoparticles with bacteria, causing
damage to the cell membrane, and (3) formation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) from light radiation.
To determine whether zinc ions were released into
solution as proposed in mechanism 1, ICP-OES was
conducted on 12.5 mL PBS solutions that were
exposed to cotton fabrics with 100-cycle ZnO ALD.
After 20 h of immersion, the concentration of Zn
was 0.255 mg/L, while after 96 h of immersion, it
was 0.243 mg/L. As such, ZnO does dissolve when
the cotton fabric is immersed in saline solution,
reaching saturation by 20 h of incubation. Mechanism 2, the interaction of nanoparticles with bacteria, does not appear to be the primary cause of
antibacterial activity in this study, because
nanoparticles are not present on the cotton fabric

surface to interfere with the cell membrane. With
respect to mechanism 3, we cannot fully eliminate
this effect because this study did not carefully
control for light versus dark exposure conditions.
However, only mechanism 1 would cause the
enhanced bacterial growth at low ZnO loading
fractions as observed in this study, hence we focus
on this mechanism.
Prior reports have indicated that zinc, in proper
concentrations, is a cofactor for over 300 proteins
and functions in bacterial enzymatic activity and
transcription.9–11,43 Bacteria rely on their transport
protein systems to regulate Zn2+ uptake and efflux
to maintain a critical homeostatic concentration
within the cell interior. Figure 4a illustrates the
Zn2+ transport protein system for low concentrations of Zn2+ ions, while Fig. 4b illustrates a different transport protein system employed by bacteria
at high Zn2+ concentration. As seen in Fig. 4a, low
concentrations of zinc ions enhance metabolic activity, thereby contributing to the increased rate of

(PBS) solutions of E. coli, with (a) low and (b) high concentrations of
zinc ions. In each of the panels, the upper left image designates
treated cotton fabric in bacterial solution, the upper middle image

reproduction seen for E. coli exposed to fabrics
coated with 1–10 cycles of ZnO (corresponding to
approximately 0.2-nm- to 2-nm-thick ZnO nanocoatings). For these ultrathin coatings, the dissolved
Zn2+ ions are essentially acting as a nutrient that
encourages bacterial growth. However, if the Zn2+
concentration is too high, the bacteria’s ion transport pathways are overwhelmed, leading to toxicity
by metal intoxication.10,43 While this precise concentration is unknown, Fig. 3 demonstrates that at
least 50 cycles of ZnO ALD supplied a sufficient
concentration of Zn2+ to overwhelm the bacteria’s
transport systems, resulting in cytotoxicity.
To better understand the extent to which ZnO
dissolution and cytotoxicity is possible under ‘‘less
wet’’ conditions, we conducted a second series of
experiments using drier test conditions. In this
series of pseudo-dry tests, a stack of three treated
cotton swatches, each 4.8 cm in diameter, were
dampened with 1 mL bacterial solution for only 5 s,
in accordance with AATCC TM100 protocol.37 After
the swatches were dampened, exposing the bacteria
to the ALD ZnO coating, they were transferred to a
sterile jar with 100 mL sterile PBS then shaken for
1 min to collect the exposed bacteria. This solution
was then sampled and plated on agar dishes. The
dishes were incubated for 20 h, and the resultant
colonies were counted. Figure 5 presents the results
of this experiment. The error bars in this figure represent the standard error for six trials. Again,
higher bacteria growth was observed for fabrics
coated with 10 cycles of ZnO. At 100 ALD cycles,
bacterial growth decreased but remained higher
than the positive control. We suspect that this
continued growth is a result of suppressed ZnO
dissolution because (1) the fabric is no longer fully
immersed in aqueous solution and (2) the exposure
time is only 5 s. As such, comparison of Figs. 3 and 5
demonstrates the significance of fully immersing

standard.37

the cotton in aqueous solution and allowing longer
exposure times in solution to enable dissolution and
ion release to create a more pronounced bacterial
response.
We conducted a temporal exposure study under
these pseudo-dry conditions to determine the effects
of dissolution kinetics on cytotoxicity. In this third
experiment, untreated cotton fabric and fabric
coated with 100 cycles of ZnO ALD were exposed
to the bacterial solution for varying amounts of time
up to 1 day. Figure 6 plots the number of colonyforming units (CFUs) counted as a function of
exposure time. The 100-cycle ZnO-coated cotton
fabric consistently showed fewer CFUs than the
untreated fabric. In fact, the untreated fabric even
demonstrated growth of bacterial lawns for three of
the four collected data points, in which the agar
plate was completely saturated with bacteria
growth; these garner an assigned value of 160
CFUs for the minimum number of colonies fitting in
the plate area.44 In contrast, the ZnO-coated fabric
demonstrated a clear decreasing trend in the number of CFUs with exposure time. After 1 day, nearly
all the bacteria were killed. Therefore, greater
exposure time resulted in significantly fewer colony-forming units on the ZnO-coated fabric, reinforcing the proposed condition that sufficient Zn2+,
as determined by the amount deposited and the
exposure time, must enter the bacteria for the
cotton fabric to exhibit antibacterial properties.

fully aqueous conditions, monotonic increase in bacteria growth was observed for cotton fabrics coated
with up to 10 cycles of ZnO ALD ( 2 nm). At 50
cycles ( 10 nm) and beyond, complete bacterial
death was observed. Here, we propose that the
mechanism for this interaction is dissolution of Zn2+
ions. At low Zn2+ concentrations, the ion acts as a
nutrient, whereas at higher loadings it becomes
cytotoxic towards E. coli. Similar enhanced growth
was observed for up to 10 ZnO ALD cycles in pseudodry growth conditions. However, for these pseudodry conditions, cytotoxicity required substantial time
to occur, as 100-cycle ZnO ALD coatings ( 20 nm)
required approximately 1 day to cause complete
E. coli death. As such, the antibacterial efficacy is
dependent upon concentration and time, as is the
solubility of metal oxides. These results indicate the
importance of both the ZnO loading fraction and
environmental test conditions for the efficacy of ZnO
as an antibacterial treatment for fabrics.

CONCLUSION
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to study
the interactions of E. coli bacteria with ZnO
nanocoatings with systematically varying thickness
(0.2–20 nm) on cotton fabrics. Both aqueous and
pseudo-dry test conditions were evaluated. While
Kääriäinen et al.45 previously demonstrated that
‘‘thick’’ (‡ 45 nm) ALD ZnO films grown on glass are
antibacterial, this study demonstrates that the ZnO–
bacteria interaction is film thickness dependent. In

Abstract: An endophytic strain of Streptomyces antimycoticus L-1 was isolated from healthy medicinal
plant leaves of Mentha longifolia L. and used for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs),
through the use of secreted enzymes and proteins. UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analyses of the Ag-NPs were carried out. The XRD, TEM, and FT-IR analysis
results demonstrated the successful biosynthesis of crystalline, spherical Ag-NPs with a particle size
of 13–40 nm. Further, the stability of the Ag-NPs was assessed by detecting the surface Plasmon
resonance (SPR) at 415 nm for one month or by measuring the NPs surface charge (−19.2 mV) by
zeta potential analysis (ζ). The green-synthesized Ag-NPs exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity at different concentrations (6.25–100 ppm) against the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus,
Bacillus subtilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium with a clear
inhibition zone ranging from (9.5 ± 0.4) nm to (21.7 ± 1.0) mm. Furthermore, the green-synthesized
Ag-NPs displayed high efficacy against the Caco-2 cancerous cell line (the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50 ) = 5.7 ± 0.2 ppm). With respect to antibacterial and in-vitro cytotoxicity analyses,
the Ag-NPs concentration of 100 ppm was selected as a safe dose for loading onto cotton fabrics.
The scanning electron microscopy connected with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX)
for the nano-finished fabrics showed the distribution of Ag-NPs as 2% of the total fabric elements.
Moreover, the nano-finished fabrics exhibited more activity against pathogenic Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria, even after 10 washing cycles, indicating the stability of the treated fabrics.

1. Introduction
Nanotechnology is a promising field with the potential for integration into various industrial
and biotechnological sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, cosmetics, biodegradation,
and wastewater treatment [1–4]. Nanoparticles (NPs) are referred to as those particles with a
size ranging between 1 and 100 nm and with distinctive physico-chemical properties [5–7]. There
are many different approaches to the fabrication of NPs, including physical, chemical, and biological
methods [8–10]. Recently, due to the spread of infections in hospitals amongst both patients and
medical staff, it has become urgent to develop medical textiles based on nanotechnology in order to
provide smart properties such as resistance to pathogenic microbes and UV protections [11,12].
Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) can be synthesized by chemical, physical, and biological methods,
where the latter remains the most widely accepted and popular, due to its fast, simple, cost-effective manner,
which avoids the use of hazardous chemicals and is free of hazardous by-products [13,14]. Biological
synthesis of Ag-NPs can be accomplished by plants, bacteria, fungi, yeast, and actinomycetes [9,15].
Ag-NPs can be incorporated into several industrial sectors, such as medicine, pharmaceuticals,
biomolecular detections, food production, agriculture, and the textile industry, due to their chemical
stability, biocompatibility, catalytic activity, high conductivity, and inherent medicinal properties [1].
Furthermore, Ag-NPs are preferred over the other metal or metal oxide NPs in the textile industry, due
to their high stability under UV illumination and high temperatures [16]. During textile manufacturing,
Ag-NPs can be added as additives to the spinning processes used for fiber manufacture or can be
utilized as a final agent for the finished textile [17,18].
Endophytes are the organisms including bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes that can colonize
internal plant tissues without invoking any adverse symptoms [19]. Endophytic microbes, especially
actinomycetes, are characterized by a huge number of their metabolites, which can be utilized
as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents in the fabrication of NPs [20]. Different species of
actinomycetes are used as biocatalyst for fabrication of Ag-NPs such as Streptacidiphilus durhamensis
HGG16n [21], Streptacidiphilus sp. CGG11n [22], Streptomyces noursei H1-1 [9], Streptomyces spp. [23].
Ag-NPs have distinctive antimicrobial qualities which make them efficient at different particle sizes
and concentrations versus a wide spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including
multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacteria [24,25]. Moreover, biogenic silver nanoparticles have
been extensively used as anticancer agents for the clinical management of cancer, as mediated through
a cytotoxic effect due to induced oxidative stress, reducing the viability and modifying the morphology
of cancer cells. Recently, many reports have focused on the potent anticancer effects of green silver
nanoparticles against colon, brain, kidney, intestinal, hepatic, epidermoid, gastronomic, laryngeal,
lung, and cervical cancer cell lines [26].
Therefore, in this study, we explore the efficacy of endophytic Streptomyces antimycoticus isolated
from healthy leaves of medicinal plant Mentha longifolia L. as a bioreactor for the biological synthesis of
Ag-NPs. The characteristics of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs are evaluated, as well as their biological
activities, including antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. Finally, a safe dose of Ag-NP coating dose,
which may provide new features for fabrics, is defined.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sample Collection
Healthy leaves of Mentha longifolia L. plants (family: Labiatae) were collected from the Rihibat
Nada site (28.538664 N and 33.921423E), Saint Katherine, South Sinai, Egypt. Plant samples were
placed in sterile polythene bags, transported to the laboratory in an icebox, and processed within 24 h.
Plant identification was achieved in the herbarium of Botany and Microbiology Department, Al-Azhar
University, Cairo, Egypt.

2.2. Isolation of Endophytic Actinomycetes
Surface sterilization of plant leaves was carried out by applying the five-step method described
by Fouda et al. [27]. Sterilized leaves were cut into pieces (1 cm × 1 cm), plated onto starch casein agar
(SCA) [28], supplemented with nalidixic acid (50 µg mL−1 ) and nystatin (25 mg mL−1 ), and incubated
at 30 ◦ C for 4 weeks. Colonies that arose from inside plant pieces and exhibited actinomycete
morphologies were purified and preserved in SCA slants for further analyses.
2.3. Molecular Identification of Actinomycetes Isolates
The purified cells of isolated endophytic actinobacteria were washed in saline solution (NaCl,
0.085%). Genomic DNA was extracted using the GeneJET Purification Kit (Thermo K0721, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). Then, 16S-rRNA genes were amplified using Maxima
Hot Start PCR Master Mix (Thermo K1051, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada) in
50 µL reactions using the universal primers of 27f (50 -AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-30 ) and
1492r (50 -TAC GGC TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT-30 ) [29]. PCR products were purified using a Gene-JET™
PCR Purification Kit (Thermo K0701), and then were sequenced on GATC Company (Ebersberg,
Germany) with an ABI 3730xl DNA sequencer using the forward and reverse primers. The bacterial
16S sequences in this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession number MT534272.
The obtained sequences and those of their most closely related taxa retrieved from GenBank were
aligned using the CLUSTAL X program [30]. Phylogenetic distances were calculated using Kimura’s
two-parameter model [31], evolutionary trees were inferred using the neighbor-joining method [32],
and the phylogenetic tree was created using the MEGA v6.1 software, with confidence testing by
bootstrap analysis (1000 repeats).
2.4. Extracellular Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles (Ag-NPs)
Ag-NPs were biologically synthesized by using pure AgNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) as a metal precursor,
with the biomass filtrate of isolated actinobacteria as the reducing agent.
Practically, three disks (0.8 mm) of freshly grown cultures of the isolated endophytic actinobacteria
were inoculated into 100 mL of starch casein broth (SCB) media and incubated at (30 ± 2) ◦ C for 96 h
in an orbital shaker (180 rpm). Then, the actinomycetes biomass was harvested, by passing the SCB
media through four layers of compact gauze. The biomass obtained was washed with sterile distilled
water, in order to remove leftovers from the growth media. The washed biomass was suspended in
100 mL of distilled water at (30 ± 2) ◦ C for 72 h. After incubation, the mixture was filtered through
filter paper (Whatman No. 1) in order to obtain the biomass filtrate, which was used as the reducing
agent for the biogenic synthesis of Ag-NPs as follows:
First, 1% (v/v) of 1 mM AgNO3 was added to 100 mL of the biomass filtrate and incubated for
24 h., at (30 ± 2) ◦ C in dark and static conditions. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 9 by 1 N
NaOH, which was added in a drop-wise manner under stirring conditions. Actinomycetes biomass
filtrate and AgNO3 were also used as controls. The synthesis of Ag-NPs was preliminarily examined
by a color change from colorless into dark or yellowish-brown and optical density measurements
in the range (300–700) nm (JENWAY 6305 Spectrophotometer,230 V/50 Hz, Staffordshire, UK) [33].
The surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) for biogenic Ag-NPs was detected after intervals (1, 3, 7, 14,
and 30) days, in order to check the stability of NPs. The biomass filtrate was used as blank for the
JENWAY 6305 Spectrophotometer.
2.5. Characterization of Biosynthesized Ag-NPs
The shapes and sizes of the biogenic Ag-NPs were identified by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM—JEOL 1010, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, a drop of NPs suspension solution was put on a carbon-coated
copper TEM grid. Extra NP solution on the TEM grid was eliminated by touching it to blotting
paper. The grid was then kept at room temperature for drying [34]. The binding properties of silver

Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 2082

nanoparticles were investigated by FT-IR analysis (Agilent system Cary 630 FTIR model, USA) in
the range 400–4000 cm−1 . The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of silver nanoparticles were analyzed
using Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (SSI), Kyoto, Japan. The X-Ray diffraction types of Ag-NPs
were obtained with the XRD–6000 series, including residual austenite quantitation, stress analysis,
crystallite size/lattice strain, crystallinity calculation, and materials analysis by overlaid XRD (Shimadzu
apparatus) with nickel filter and Cu–Ka target. The 2θ values were measured in a range from 4◦ to 90◦ .
The NPs sizes obtained from XRD analysis were estimated by Scherrer’s formula:
D = 0.94λ/β cos θ
where D is the mean particle size, 0.94 is the Scherrer’s constant, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the
half of the maximum intensity, and θ is the Bragg’s angle.
Furthermore, investigation of the distribution, size, and poly-dispersity index (PDI) of biogenic
Ag-NPs in the colloidal solution was carried out using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique.
The biogenic Ag-NPs were suspended in distilled H2 O and exposed to a Zeta sizer nano-series
(Nano ZS, Malvern, UK). Furthermore, the stability of actinobacterial mediated Ag-NPs synthesis was
analyzed using Zeta Potential measurement.
2.6. Antibacterial Activity of Ag-NPs
The antibacterial activity of the biogenic Ag-NPs was examined against five selected bacterial
pathogens: two Gram-positive strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
6538) and three Gram-negative strains (Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
ATCC 9022 and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739). Freshly grown cultures of the selected bacterial strains
were individually prepared in sterile saline solutions at a concentration of (1.5 × 108 ) CFU/mL, seeded
in Mueller-Hinton agar media. According to the agar well diffusion method, 3 wells (0.8 cm diameter)
were cut in the seeded Mueller-Hinton plates and 100 µL of Ag-NPs (100 ppm) was added into each
well. The plates were kept in the refrigerator for 1 h, then incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦ C. The diameter
of the potential growth inhibition zones around each well was recorded (mm). Different Ag-NP
concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 75.0 ppm) were prepared, in order to determine the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each bacterial pathogen [35]. The experiments were carried out
in triplicates.
2.7. Cytotoxic Activity of Ag-NPs Against Cancer and Normal Cells
The potential cytotoxicity of the actinobacterial-synthesized Ag-NPs was assessed by the MTT
[3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay using human colorectal
adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and normal Vero cells (kidney of African green monkey) procured from
ATCC. These cancerous and normal cell lines were chosen as a model for cancerous and normal cell
lines, respectively. The cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a concentration of (1 × 105 ) cells/well
and treated with double-fold dilutions of the biologically synthesized Ag-NPs (3.9–1000 µg/mL). After
48 h of incubation, morphological changes that occurred in epithelial cells as a result of treatment with
silver nanoparticles were monitored using an inverted light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For the
MTT assay, cancer and normal cells were grown in 96-well plates at (1 × 105 ) cells/well and treated
with a series of double-fold concentrations (3.9–1000 µg/mL) of the biogenic Ag-NPs and incubated at
37 ◦ C for 48 h. MTT (5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well and incubated at
37 ◦ C for 1–5 h at 37 ◦ C with 5% carbon dioxide. A purple formazan crystal was formed, which was
dissolved by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (10%). Plates were kept in a plate shaker for 30 min in the
dark. Finally, the optical density of the samples was measured using a multi-well ELISA plate reader
at 560 nm [36]. The percentage of cell viability was calculated using the following formula:
Cell viability % = (sample absorbance/control absorbance) × 100.

2.8. Application of Ag-NPs for Medical Fabrics
2.8.1. Loading the Biogenic Ag-NPs onto the Cotton Textile Using the Pad–Dry–Cure Method
Cotton fabrics were washed with warm water and dried. The cotton textile was then cut into pieces
(15 cm × 30 cm) and soaked in an aqueous solution of biogenic Ag-NPs (at a safe concentration based
on the cytotoxicity tests). For the subsequent processing of fabrics with colloidal silver, the solution
was constantly stirred. Fabric samples were immersed in the colloidal bath for 1 min and then
thoroughly squeezed under constant pressure using a laboratory pad. Then, the samples were dried at
70 ◦ C for 3 min, and ironed at 150 ◦ C for 2 min. The experiment was conducted using the following
treatments: (1) non-processed fabrics as a control, (2) fabrics treated with Ag-NPs, and (3) fabrics
treated with Ag-NPs and washed five or ten repeated wash cycles. Each washing cycle lasted 45 min
in a warm-water washing machine containing 2% sodium carbonate. At the end of the washing cycle,
the fabric was dried in a dryer at 80 ◦ C.
2.8.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy for Nanocoated Fabrics
The surface characteristics of the treated fabrics and their metal nanoparticle contents were
evaluated using SEM (JSM-5400, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX).
2.8.3. Antibacterial Activity of Nano-Coated Fabrics
The antibacterial potential of nano-coated fabrics was assessed against bacterial pathogens:
Gram-positive strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538) and
Gram-negative strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9022 and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739). Each
bacterial pathogen was seeded into Mueller-Hinton agar media and left to solidify. Then, 1 cm squares
of each fabric sample were aseptically prepared, and put onto the agar surface, and incubated for one
day. After incubation, the plates were examined, and the diameters of the growth inhibition zones
(mm) were recorded around the fabric samples. The experiment was carried out using the following
treatments: (1) untreated fabrics as a control, (2) fabrics treated with Ag-NPs, and (3) fabrics treated
with Ag-NP and washed 5 and 10 repeated wash cycles.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
All results presented in this study are the means of three independent replicates. Data were
subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) by the statistical package SPSS v17. The mean difference
comparison between the treatments was analyzed by the Tukey HSD test at a significance level of
p ≤ 0.05.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Isolation and Molecular Identification of Endophytic Actinomycetes
Medicinal plants are considered as adequate shelters for several endophytic microbes, including
bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes [14]. Therefore, the isolation of these endophytic microbes, especially
from plants inhabiting harsh environments, opens up promising strategies for different biotechnological
applications. In this study, an endophytic actinobacterial isolate of L-1 was obtained from healthy
leaves of Mentha longifolia L.; based on BLAST analysis, the endophytic actinomycetes isolate obtained
in this study was identified as Streptomyces antimycoticus L-1, with similarity percentage of 98% related
to Streptomyces antimycoticus (accession number: NR_041080). The phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA
sequences showed homology of the obtained sequence to Streptomyces antimycoticus with a bootstrap
percentage of more than 90% (Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the
isolation of Streptomyces antimycoticus from the medicinal plant M. longifolia for use as a biocatalyst for
Ag-NPs synthesis.

3.3.5. DLS Analysis
The size of Ag-NPs in the colloidal solution was estimated by dynamic light scattering analysis,
through the reaction of light beams with the biosynthesized NPs [60]. The diameter of nanoparticles in
the colloidal solution (100%) was approximately 90.2 nm (Figure 4C). The size of Ag-NPs acquired
from DLS analysis was bigger than those attained from TEM and XRD analyses. These results could
be attributed to the size assembled from DLS depending on actinobacterial metabolites that had
accumulated on the particle surface, which were responsible for reducing, capping, and stabilizing.
Furthermore, the metallic core and non-homogeneous particle distributions have been correlated to
bigger NPs sizes under DLS [60,61]. On the other hand, through the assessment of PDI values, DLS
analysis provides an articulation about the homogeneity of NPs in colloidal solutions. The homogeneity
of the NPs solution is increased or decreased if PDI value is more or less than 0.4, while it is heterogeneous
if the PDI value is ≤1. The obtained data highlighted that the PDI value of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs
was equal to 0.5. Furthermore, the stability of the biogenic Ag-NPs was distinguished by zeta potential
analysis (ζ) through the measurement of surface particle charge. In this study, the ζ value for Ag-NPs
was recorded as −19.2 mV, which reflects the stability of the biosynthesized NPs solution. These results
are compatible with those of other UV–vis spectroscopy analyses, in which the ζ values of Ag-NPs
synthesized by Streptomyces noursei H1-1 and Trichderma longibrachiatum were −18.9 mV, and −19.7 mV,
respectively [9,62].
3.4. Antibacterial Activity of Ag-NPs
The antibacterial performance of the biogenic silver nanoparticle suspension was evaluated against
selected pathogenic bacteria using the well-diffusion assay. The investigated bio-colloidal silver offered
auspicious nano-antibiotic properties, with broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Ag-NPs by an agar well
diffusion test has been previously carried out [63]. Silver nanoparticles at 12.5 ppm exhibited inhibitory
effects against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, forming inhibition zones (ZOI)
of (13.3 ± 0.6), (9.5 ± 0.4), and (10.3 ± 0.3) mm, respectively. It has been proven that the antibacterial
activity of silver nanoparticles depends on the concentration. For example, at a Ag-NP concentration
of 25 ppm, higher activities were seen against bacterial pathogens, with recorded ZOIs of (13.6 ± 0.7),
(12.5 ± 0.4), and (13 ± 0.8) mm corresponding to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, respectively. Moreover, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium showed sensitivity
to bio-colloidal silver at 25 ppm, with recorded ZOIs of (10.16 ± 0.7) and (9.5 ± 0.4) mm, respectively.
The Streptomyces-derived Ag-NPs showed enhanced antibacterial activity against all tested pathogens
at 50 ppm, and 75 ppm. The maximum antibacterial activity was seen with the highest nano-silver
concentration of 100 ppm, which exhibited the highest ZOIs values of (16.33 ± 0.5), (21.7 ± 1.0),
(18.3 ± 0.5), (20.3 ± 1.4) and (15.3 ± 0.6) mm for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. Moreover, Bacillus subtilis presented
the highest sensitivity to the silver nano-antibiotics, while the lowest sensitivity was assigned to
Salmonella typhimurium. Bio-colloidal silver synthesized from actinomycetes have exhibited an efficient
nano-antibiotics and antibacterial activities [64]. Corresponding with our investigations, the well
diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of Streptomyces sp-induced silver
nanoparticles, which displayed good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [65]. The antibacterial potential
of the silver nanomaterials from Streptomyces parvus against various pathogens, including S. aureus,
E. coli, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, has been recently reported [66]. The antibacterial
properties of biogenic Ag-NPs may be attributed to different mechanisms, such as charge influence of
Ag-NPs. The partial dissolution of the bacterial cell membrane may be achieved due to the electrostatic
attraction between the negative charge of the cell wall and the positive charge of the silver nanomaterial
or by the interaction of nano-scaled silver with phosphorylated or sulfur proteins of the bacterial cell
wall, causing the destabilization and depolarization of bacteria membrane to lose its integrity and

Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 2082

leakage of H+ [67]. Anther mechanism of biological toxicity of Ag-NPs could be attributed to the release
of Ag+ through oxidation process. In this mechanism, Ag-NPs act as a carrier for Ag+ , once liberated,
Ag+ reacts with phosphate, thiol group of cysteine amino acids, glutamine amino acid, and carboxyl
group, leading to bacterial death [68,69]. Moreover, the biocidal effect of Ag-NPs could be attributed to
elevated ROS as a result of Ag+ release, which destroys cellular respiration enzymes and the ultimate
result is cell death [46]. Recently, Alsharif et al. [9] reported the extracellular synthesis of Ag-NPs by
Streptomyces noursei H1-1 and declared the potential antibacterial activity of these nanoparticles in
low concentrations (25 ppm and 50 ppm) against the selected pathogens S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa,
E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. aureus. In the same context, Wypij et al. [70] reported the biogenic synthesis of
Ag-NPs from Streptomyces xinghaiensis OF1 with efficient nano-antibiotic properties against B. subtilis,
S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Dong et al. [25] announced the bacteriostatic action of biosynthetic
Ag-NPs against Vibrio Natriegens; additionally, they indicated an inverse relationship between the size
of nanoparticles and their antibacterial activity. Our results revealed that the Streptomyces-derived
Ag-NPs were active at low concentration (25 ppm) against all selected pathogens. The MIC values
of biosynthesized Ag-NPs against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. typhimurium were
25.0 ppm, 12.5 ppm, 12.5 ppm, 12.5 ppm and 25.0 ppm, respectively, with ZOIs of (10.16 ± 0.7),
(13.3

applications [75]. Accordingly, the current study was designed to assess the potential anticancer
activity of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs. Therefore, an MTT experiment was performed to estimate
the cytotoxic effect of Ag-NPs synthesized by S. antimycoticus against the cancerous Caco-2 (human
colon cancer) and normal Vero (kidney of African green monkey) cell lines. MTT is an accurate
colorimetric method that is commonly used to evaluate cellular toxicity, as well as cell proliferation
and viability. The microscopic investigation of cell lines exposed to Ag-NPs exhibited the cytotoxicity
of nanoparticles against mammalian cells, which resulted in the loss of the characteristic monolayer of
these epithelial cells. Moreover, we found that the cytotoxic properties of Ag-NPs were dose-dependent.
The reduced viability of cancerous caco-2 cell lines could be attributed to the apoptotic effect induced
by the biogenic silver nanoparticles. However, other mechanisms for cytotoxicity of Ag-NPs have
been studied, such as modifying the mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation, leakage
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), activation of apoptotic caspases, ROS generation and nuclear
fragmentation [76]. In agreement with our results, the Streptomyces noursei H1-1-based Ag-NPs
manifested a functional dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against cancerous cell lines, where very low
concentrations (5.6 ± 3.0 µg/mL) of Ag-NPs inhibited 50% of caco-2 (cancer cell line); while the normal

3.6. Application of Ag-NPs for Medical Fabrics
3.6.1. Loading Biogenic Ag-NPs onto Cotton Textile
Cotton fabric pieces were washed with warm water and subjected to a simple pad technique,
in order to be loaded with a solution of the biologically manufactured Ag-NPs (100 ppm); this
concentration was deemed safe for the normal cell line (based on our investigations of cytotoxicity).
The color of treated fabrics by a safe Ag-NPs dose tends to be a pale yellow. Washing and flooding
fabrics with water before nano-finishing composes a negative charge on the surface of the textile, such
that the positively charged Ag-NPs would be electrostatically attracted to that negative charge on the
fabric surface [79]. The surface morphology of textile samples was then examined by SEM. The blank
fabric showed a refined overlapping fibrous frame with a soft surface, without any contaminants or
depositions (Figure 7A). As for the treated fabric, although it seemed to retain its structure, its surface
was covered with Ag-NPs that were incorporated into the tissue fibers and evenly dispersed across the
surface of the textile (Figure 7B,C). In this respect, Xing et al. [80] reported the effective deposition
of nano-sized silver, which was homogeneously distributed on the textile surface. In the present
study, our characterization of the Streptomyces-derived Ag-NPs revealed their small size (13–40 nm),
which could support their adhesion to the fabric surface, as it is expected that smaller particles can
penetrate deeply into the fabric and tightly adhere to the textile fibers. Furthermore, EDX spectroscopy
determined the chemical elements of the nano-finished fabrics, declaring peaks corresponding to C and
O, as well as an incoming peak monitored around 3 keV, which could be attributed to the nano-scale
silver particles. Silver nanoparticles represented about 2% of the total elements on the modified fabrics
surface and approximately 0.38% of the weight of the surface elements (Figure 7D). Accordingly,
the SEM/EDX results confirmed the existence of Ag-NPs attached to the textile surface. In line with
the current study, Othman et al. [81] reported the efficient application of bio-fabricated Ag-NPs for
functionalizing nano-finished fabrics with antimicrobial properties; their EDX spectra showed a strong
peak around 3.0 keV, thus demonstrating the deposition of nano-sized silver on the textile surface.
Our results showed that the bio-silver nanoparticles effectively integrated into the surface of the treated
fabrics and formed a reinforced surface layer; thus, they can be used as finishing materials for the
multifunctional fabrics.
3.6.2. Antibacterial Activity of Nano-Coated Fabrics
Fabrics in contact with the human body provide a moist and warm climate for microorganisms; as
such, sweaty clothes are considered a perfect environment for bacterial outgrowth and propagation [82,83].
Therefore, the development of Ag-based antimicrobial fabrics for the treatment of clinical bandages
and clothing is a promising solution for biomedical applications. Moreover, nano-finished textiles
possess water- and/or oil-repellent properties [84], thus contributing to prevention of microbial growth
on the processed fabrics.
The antibacterial activities of nano-finished fabrics have been qualitatively evaluated against
selected pathogenic bacteria by investigating zones of inhibition. Our investigations revealed that
blank fabric pieces had no antibacterial effects either before or after laundering. On the contrary,
the Ag-based biological fabrics exhibited significant antibacterial activity. Although the biogenic
colloidal silver was applied at a low concentration, its regular distribution across the fabric surface
provided broad-spectrum activity. The silver-coated fabrics presented the highest activity against
B. subtilis, recording an inhibition zone of (2.7 ± 0.3) mm, while the minimum inhibition zone was
registered for P. aeruginosa (1.3 ± 0.01 mm). Furthermore, the modified textile displayed significant
antibacterial properties versus E. coli and S. aureus, recording growth inhibition zones of (2.1 ± 0.2),
(1.8 ± 0.1) mm, respectively. Washing fastness is a key factor for nano-finished fabrics to remain
applicable; it has been noticed that the efficacy of the Ag- fabrics against tested bacteria reduced after
washing. However, our results demonstrated the durability of the proposed silver-based fabrics, which
retained their biocidal potential after even 10 repetitive washing cycles (Table 1). Nevertheless, Ag-NPs

4. Conclusions
In this study, healthy leaves of the medicinal plant Mentha longifolia L. were collected from Rihibat
Nada, Saint Katherine, South Sinai, Egypt, and used for the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria, which
was identified as Streptomyces antimycoticus L-1 based on 16S rRNA sequencing. The S. antimycoticus
L-1 strain was used as a biocatalyst for reducing, capping, and stabilizing Ag-NPs. A color change
from colorless to yellowish-brown was the first monitored for the green synthesis of Ag-NPs using
metabolites involving the biomass filtrate of endophytic S. antimycoticus L-1. Physico-chemical Ag-NPs
characterizations were achieved by UV–vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, TEM, XRD, DLS and zeta potential
analyses. The data confirmed the preparation of crystalline, spherical Ag-NPs with an average
size of 13–40 nm at maximum SPR 415 nm, which remained stable for a long time. In addition,
our data demonstrated the high stability and homogeneity of Ag-NPs, with a negative surface
charge of −19.2 mV and polydispersity index (PDI) equal to 0.5. Analysis of the biological activities
of the green-synthesized Ag-NPs revealed their efficacy as bactericidal agents against pathogenic
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as their in-vitro cytotoxicity against a cancerous cell
line. Furthermore, cotton fabrics treated with a safe Ag-NPs dose (100 ppm) acquired new functional
properties, including self-cleaning against pathogenic bacteria.

Abstract
In this study, we are reporting biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles and hydrothermal synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles. Using convenient mechanical milling methods, nanocomposites with superior photocatalytic and catalytic properties
are synthesized. Herein, we have adopted a green, eco-friendly, and economical route for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles
using Zingiber officinalae rhizome extract in an aqueous solution. The synthesized materials were characterized using
UV–Vis spectroscopy, XRD, SEM & FE-SEM, FT-IR, Raman, and a particle size analyzer with zeta potential analysis.
The photocatalytic activities of Ag, ZnO and their composites were studied by observing the degradation of methylene blue
and crystal violet dyes under natural sunlight. Then the catalytic efficacies of synthesized nanoparticles for various organic
transformation reactions were studied. Ag–ZnO nanocomposites were predicted to have improved photocatalytic activity
and organic transformation reactions, allowing them to be used in environmental remediation applications.

Introduction
Today nanomaterials are used in almost every sector of
science and technology to improve human lives and the
environment in numerous ways. The first evidence of a link
between human life and the nanoscale is probably can be
found in Ayurveda, which is a 5000-year-old Indian system of medicine. Even before the term nanotechnology was
invented, Ayurveda had some understanding of nanomedicine manufacturing and their effects (Prasad and Elumalai
2011; Prasad et al. 2021). The creation of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) is well documented in the ancient Ayurvedic
literature, Ras-Ratnakar (Nazeruddin et al. 2014). Nanomaterials have features that are substantially distinct from bulk

counterparts at the nanoscale, and they can be employed in
solar cells, lithium ion batteries, bio-sensors, gas sensors,
memristors, transistors, in smart textiles, veterinary medicines or as catalysts for chemical transformation reactions
(Mahdieh et al. 2012). Because metal NPs are biocompatible and employed in water purification, catalysis, and other
applications, there has been a lot of interest in developing
approaches for the controlled synthesis of metal NPs with
well-defined shapes, sizes, and compositions (Khan et al.
2012).
When discussing the causes of water pollution in conventional sectors, the use of non-green chemicals in manufacturing comes up (Liao et al. 2021). Hazardous slurries are
employed in traditional industries to manufacture or polish
high-performance devices, which are commonly used in the
semiconductor, microelectronics, and aerospace industries
(Zhang and Su 2020). To address this issue, green synthesis nanoparticles, nanomaterials, and nanotechnology are
being used to develop new green slurries (Zhang and Su
2020), diamond wheels(Zhang et al. 2017), and machining processes(Zhang et al. 2015) that will be used to find
alternative green products in industries. High-performance
surfaces are created using developed slurries, equipment and

processes that are exceptionally challenging to construct in
traditional industries (Zhenyu et al. 2012). Nevertheless,
these studies are a watershed moment for traditional industries and dramatically lower pollution levels in the environment. (Cui et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2022).
The presence of carbonyl groups found in aspartic acid
and/or glutamine residues, as well as the hydroxyl residues
of proteins, is believed to be a viable reaction center for the
creation of NPs using plant extracts. One of the goals of
employing plant extracts was to establish a quick synthesis
of NPs that took only a few hours, as opposed to the traditional biosynthetic method involving microorganisms, which
takes 2–4 days to completely reduce metal ions. Few medicinal plants are known to have antioxidant properties, which
means they can operate as a biological supply of reducing
agents. The properties of material at nanoscale depends upon
their size and shape. The size and shape of the particles
are influenced by various factors such as concentration of
solution, pH, reaction temperature, nature of reducing agent
and capping agents and time of contact. The considerable
work in the domain of biogenic synthesis of transition metal
nanomaterials were done by S. Shiv Shankar (Shankar et al.
2004). The manufacture of Ag and Au NPs using Azadirachata indica decoction solution was reported by S. Shiv
Shankar et al. The NPs, are in the 50–100 nm range and are
not well separated from one another (Shankar et al. 2004).
In-vitro biogenic fabrication of materials at nanoscale is
a promising topic for biodiversity-rich countries like India,
in particular. Biodiversity can thus be leveraged as a valuable resource for biotechnological products and processes,
including large-scale production of NPs of various sizes
and forms (Ahmad et al. 2010). Herein, an attempt has been
made for extra cellular bio-synthesis of transition metal NPs
using ginger rhizome extracts. In a tropical country like
India, Zingiber officinale, which belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, is a widely available herb that is extensively
utilized in Indian cuisine. It's been used for centuries to cure
bronchitis, carminative, hypertension, migraines, and other
diseases. Apart from this during the recent pandemic situation of Covid-19, ginger was highly recommended from
Ayurvedic doctors. This plant’s rhizome extract is known to
have diuretic qualities and is used as a cleaner and analgesic
agent in ear drops. In comparison to aspirin, this plant is also
used to enhance appetite and cure asthma, and it is thought
to be a possible anti-platelet agent. It has anti-inflammatory
and analgesic qualities similar to non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications, but without the gastrointestinal bleeding
and ulcer development adverse effects (Pawar et al. 2015).
The rhizome extract of Zingiber officinale is utilized here as
a reducing and stabilizing agent. As a result, this process is
both environmentally friendly and cost-effective when compared to other methods of synthesis. Protein in the aqueous extract could function as a bio-ligand. This approach

synthesized NPs that were well dispersed and showed no
signs of aggregation.

Experimental section
Materials
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 30 wt% Ammonia solution, Silver nitrate ­(AgNO3), Methylene Blue (MB)
and Crystal Violet (CV) dye, Analytical grade 4-Nitrophenol ­( C 6H 5NO 3) (4-NP), 2-Nitroaniline (­C 6H 6N 2O 2)
(2-NA), 3-Nitroaniline ­(C6H6N2O2) (3-NA), 4-Nitroaniline
­(C6H6N2O2) (4-NA), and Sodium Borohydride ­(NaBH4)
chemicals are procured form Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee
(USA). The fresh Zingiber officinale rhizome is procured
from the local market in India (N-16.67.35, E-74.25.32).
Bio‑genic synthesis of Ag nanoparticles (NPs)
To prepare the extract, 10 g of rhizome was taken and properly cleansed in running tap water followed by distilled water
so as to remove any foreign material adhered to the surface. Then the rhizome was macerated overnight in 100 mL
of double distilled water. It was then coarsely crushed in a
grinder mixer, filtered with absorbent cotton, and the filtrate
was stored in a stoppered glass bottle. The extracted solution was stored at a 4 °C temperature in the refrigerator for
further use.
A 250 mL beaker was filled with 100 mL of 0.1 M ­AgNO3
solution. Then, in the burette, 50 mL of Zingiber officinale
rhizome extract was filled and dropwise added with constant
stirring into the beaker containing the A
­ gNO3 solution. During the biosynthesis process we maintained normal room
temperature and pressure. After the addition of a sufficient
amount of rhizome extract to the beaker containing A
­ gNO3
solution, we observed a black coloured precipitate in the
reaction mixture. This black-coloured precipitate can be
separated from the reaction mixture using high-speed centrifugation operating at 5000 rpm. To eliminate organic contaminants soluble in alcohol, the separated precipitate was
washed twice with ethanol. The black coloured solid mass
was kept in the oven for drying at 60 °C. The entire drying
process produced a black coloured substance, which was
ground in a mortar-pestle and sampled for characterization.
Mechanism of biosynthesis of metallic NPs
The synthesis of Ag NPs by biological entities is due to the
presence of a large number of organic chemicals like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, enzymes, coenzymes, phenols, flavonoids and alkaloids. The literature survey reveals that the
primary components of Zingiber officinale include gingerol,

Applied Nanoscience (2022) 12:2207–2226

shogaol, regin, and starch. As a result, the plant rhizome
extract can act as a reducing agent and a capping agent,
preventing the NPs from agglomeration (Yeh et al. 2014).
The synthesis of Ag NPs is the result of the reduction of A
­ g+
ions, which is followed by agglomeration into oligomeric
clusters. These clusters eventually result in the creation of
colloidal Ag particles with nanometer-sized dimensions. The
solution displays a black colour with a prominent band in
the 370–440 nm range and other less strong or smaller bands
at a longer wavelength in the UV–Vis absorption spectrum.
The active ingredient responsible for the reduction of ­Ag+
ions varies depending upon the extract used. For nano-During transformation of A
­ g+ into Ag NPs, electrons are supposed to be derived from dehydrogenation of acids (ascorbic
acid) and alcohols (catechol) in hydrophytes, Keto to Enol
conversions (paraquinone, dietchequinone, remain) in mesophytes or both mechanisms in xerophytic plants (Aziz and
Jassim 2018).

Hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanorods
Herein, for the synthesis of zinc oxide nanorods, we have
used zinc nitrate as a precursor. In this experiment, we prepared an aqueous 0.2 M zinc nitrate solution. Then 100 mL
of the zinc nitrate solution was taken in a beaker and kept
on a magnetic stirrer, and 30 wt% ammonia solution was
filled in the burette. At first, after the addition of a few mL
of ammonia (­ NH3) to the solution, there is the formation of
a cloudy solution. After further addition of ammonia, the
solution becomes colorless. The resultant reaction solution
is transferred to an autoclave system and hydrothermally
treated at 120 °C for 90 min. After the accomplishment of
the reaction, the consequent system was allowed to cool
down to room temperature. Then the synthesized powder
was washed twice with DDW and ethanol, respectively, and
kept for air drying at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the
ZnO nanorod was annealed for 2 h at 450 °C (Liu and Zeng
2003). Then the resultant product is ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Herein, when zinc nitrate is
treated with ammonium hydroxide, the formation of zinc
hydroxide takes place. This, upon hydrothermal treatment,
gets converted into zinc oxide. The possible reaction mechanism may be as below.

Preparation of nanocomposites
At the end of two different experimentation processes, we
get Ag NPs and ZnO nanorods. Now we have to make composites of nanoparticles, i.e., nanocomposites of different

2209

concentrations. To make nanocomposites, we have followed
solid state reaction pathways at room temperature.
For the preparation of the nanocomposite by the solidstate reaction at room temperature, we took ZnO nanorods
and Ag NPs in the ratio of 95:05 weight ratios for 5% w/w
and 90:10 weight ratio for 10% w/w. We put the sample in a
mortar and ground it with a pestle for 3 h. It is very similar
to the mechanical milling phenomena, i.e., by this, using
the friction force, there is a cut down of bulk material into
nanoregions. Using this method, we synthesized a uniform
Ag–ZnO nanocomposite. During the reaction, we uniformly
milled the nanomaterials in one direction. Practically, there
is no formation of any primary bonds like ionic, covalent, or
metallic bonding. However, between the NPs and nanorods,
it looks like there are some weak attractive and repulsive
physical forces are present. These forces are due to secondary bonds like Van Der wall’s bond.

Characterization
Once a nanomaterial has been developed or synthesized, it
becomes necessary to check its particle size, shape, surface
charge, and morphology. As NPs are beyond the perception of human eyes, it becomes important to use various
advanced characterization techniques. Spectroscopic and
microscopic approaches are extensively used as characterization techniques. At the end of the experiment, we got fine
white coloured ZnO nanorods and black coloured Ag NPs.
Nanomaterial characteristics largely depend upon their size
and form. The methods of characterization utilized are listed
below.
A UV–Vis Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies,
Cary 60) was used to examine the optical absorbance spectra
of ZnO nanorods, Ag NPs, and nanocomposite of Ag–ZnO
(5% w/w) and Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) in the wavelength
range of 200–800 nm. X-ray diffraction spectra are used to
describe the crystal structures of Ag NPs, ZnO nanorods,
and Ag–ZnO nanocomposite (Bruker D8 advanced, Germany). Using a scanning electron microscope (Model JEOLJSM-6360, Japan) and an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, the
surface morphology of Ag NPs, ZnO nanorods, Ag–ZnO
(10% w/w), and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite were
investigated. The FT-IR spectra were acquired using KBr
pellets on an ALPHA Bruker FT-IR spectrometer. Wavenumbers ranging from 4000 to 400 ­cm−1 were used to characterize the samples. On a Nano ZS 90, the particle size
and zeta potential were measured (Malvern, UK). Raman
analysis using Ranishaw invia Raman spectroscope ranges
from 0 to 3000 ­cm−1.

Dye degradation assay
The catalytic activities of synthesized nanomaterials were
studied against the Methylene Blue (MB) and Crystal Violet
(CV) of aqueous dye solution for dye degradation. A reaction of degradation was carried out as follows: 0.08 g of
nanomaterials (1 mg/mL) was thoroughly mixed with 80 mL
of aqueous dye solution (10 mg/lit.) in a 100 mL beaker
by continuous stirring for 24 h in the dark (For maximum
Adsorption on the surface of our nanomaterial). After 24 h,
the reaction solution was exposed to sunlight. The absorption intensity in a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at regular
15-min time intervals could be used to analyze the degradation of the aqueous dye solution. That leads to a colour
change from blue/violet to colorless. The dye degradation
percentage is obtained using Eq. (1),

where, At represents the dye solution's absorbance intensity over time interval t, and A0 is the dye solution's initial
absorbance intensity.

Catalytic reduction reaction assay
The catalytic efficacy of synthesized Ag NPs was also investigated by reducing nitro-group-containing organic compounds in the presence of the strong reducing agent ­NaBH4.
While ZnO nanorods and their nanocomposite do not show
strong catalytic reduction reactions against nitro-group containing compounds, the catalytic reduction reaction procedure was carried out as follows.
In a 3.0 mL eppendorf tube, 1.5 mL of 50 mM N
­ aBH4 ice
cold solution was mixed with 1.5 mL of 1.0 mM nitro-group
containing compounds aqueous solution and 200 μL of Ag NPs
solution (1 mg/mL). The overall concentrations of nitro-group
containing compounds and ­NaBH4 were 1 and 50 mM, respectively. The solution was transferred to a standard quartz cell (path
length of 1 cm and volume of 3.0 mL) for UV–Vis spectrophotometric analysis within the range from 200 to 800 nm. The absorption in a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature with a
regular 30 s time interval could be used to analyze the reduction
reaction(Baruah et al. 2013; Divband et al. 2013; Remita et al.
2013; Sahiner et al. 2013; Deka et al. 2014; Aditya et al. 2017).

Resonance (SPR) is responsible for the colour of colloidal
Ag NPs, ZnO nanorods, and Ag–ZnO nanocomposites. SPR
is caused by the collective oscillation of free-conduction
electrons driven by an interacting electromagnetic field. The
black-coloured Ag NPs sample powder, the white-pinkish
coloured ZnO nanorod sample powder, and the grey coloured ZnO-Ag nanocomposites were all dissolved separately
in deionized water and sonicated. The solution was then
placed in a cuvette and subjected to UV–Vis light, with the
absorbance of the solution being measured. For different
nanoparticle solutions, the Surface Plasmon resonant (SPR)
peak occurs at a distinct wavelength, and according to the
theory of resonance, the maximum wavelength is absorbed
at the resonant wavelength. According to the literature, typical Ag NPs exhibit the characteristic SPR at wavelengths
ranging from 370 to 440 nm, with the wavelength varying
with particle size (Zhao et al. 2006). Figure 1a displays colloidal SPR bands centering at 392 nm, confirming the existence of Ag NPs in the produced solution.
The UV–Vis spectra of Ag NPs, ZnO nanorods, and
Ag–ZnO nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 1a–d. It has
a well-defined absorption peak at 209 nm for Fig. 1d
ZnO nanorods. For Ag–ZnO nanocomposite, i.e., Fig. 1b
Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) nanocomposite and Fig. 1c Ag–ZnO
(5% w/w) nanocomposite, have the maximum absorption
peak both at 209 and 392 nm, respectively.

XRD study
The formation of poly-dispersed crystalline nano-material is
revealed by the XRD pattern. Figure 2a–d shows the XRD
patterns of synthesised Ag NPs, ZnO, and their nanocomposites. The peak position describes the translational symmetry of the unit cell, essentially its size and structure.

Figure 2a shows the XRD pattern of Ag NPs. Bragg's
reflections can be observed in the XRD pattern 2θ at 38.12,
44.31, 64.46, and 77.41, which correspond to the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively, indicating that
Ag NPs were nanocrystals with face centered cubic (FCC)
structure. The patterns were consistent and matched with
card No. 01-089-3722 in the Joint Committee on Powder
Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database.
The ZnO nanorods (Fig. 2d) are polycrystalline with a
hexagonal wurzite-type structure (JCPDS card No. 01-0760704). The ZnO nanorods were observed at 2θ values at
31.737, 34.379, 36.215, 47.484, 56.536, 62.777, 66.304,
67.868, 69.009, 72.465, 76.867 and81.270 representing (h

and Zeng 2003; Polsongkram et al. 2008; Upadhaya and
Dhar Purkayastha 2020). Both JCPDS cards give confirmation of the purity of synthesized nanomaterial and nanocomposite (Fig. 2b, c). No further impurities are present in the
synthesized samples.
The Debye–Scherer’s formula (Eq. (2)) was used to calculate the crystallite size of the nanomaterials from the Full

Width at Half Maxima (FWHM) denoted by β and the Diffraction angle (θ),

D=

0.9𝜆
,
𝛽 cos 𝜃

(2)

where λ is the wavelngth of X-ray used for diffraction
(0.15406 nm).
The crystallite size for various samples is calculated using
the above formala and is represented in Table 1 for Ag NPs
and in Table 2 for zinc oxide nanorods (Suryavanshi et al.
2018a).
Morphology Index (MI)
The interrelation between particle size and morphology
determines the specific surface area of a nanoparticle.
FWHM is used to determine MI. MI is calculated using the
following formula:

MI =

FWHMh
.
FWHMh + FWHM p

(3)

The particulate FWHM value of a peak is F
­ WHMp, and
the highest FWHM value obtained from peaks is ­FWHMh.
MI value of Ag NPs varies from 0.5 to 0.8797 (Table 1)
and ZnO nanorods calculated values vary from 0.5 to 0.8682
(Table 2). It is correlated with the crystalline particle size
and Specific Surface Area (SSA). SSA value of Ag NPs is
6.4183–38.7495 ­m2/g (Table 1) and nanorods show SSA
value from 6.9981 to 40.5954 ­m2/g (Table 2). According
to the estimated data, MI is linearly proportional to particle
size and inversely proportional to SSA with a slight variation. Figures 3a, b and 4a, b show the results. The deviations
and correlations between the figures are indicated by the
linear fit (Vinila et al. 2014; Suryavanshi et al. 2018b).

Surface morphology
The SEM image from Fig. 5a–d reveals the formation of
a cluster of spherical beads, similar to the structure of Ag
NPs, with a non-uniform distribution. Figure 5a indicates
the formation of relatively spherical-shaped Ag NPs with

and some larger particles were found infrequently agglomerated together (Twu et al. 2008). Figure 5f, g and include
the FE-SEM image of Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) and Ag–ZnO

randomly dispersed around the ZnO nanorods, in which it
is seen that the number of Ag np’s is greater in the Ag–ZnO
(10% w/w) as compared to the Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) (Wu
et al. 2013). Furthermore, FE-SEM image of ZnO sample is
shown in Fig. 5h. It can be clearly seen that the ZnO sample comprises needle-like nanorods, addition to that, ZnO
nanorods also show the unvarying uniform growth in aligned
direction and a mean diameter of about 4000–7000 nm (Gao

FT-IR is the fingerprint for atomic and molecular vibrations.
Here, we observe different types of vibrations of the analyzed samples. The bending vibration of –OH groups was
linked to the transmittance band at 1555 ­cm−1 for Fig. 6a
Ag NPs. The band at 1361 ­cm−1 is attributed to the –CH2
group’s deformation stretching. The bending of the C–C
bond is described by the peak at 515 ­cm−1. The band at
3424 ­cm−1 was attributed to the hydrogen bond stretching
vibration of –OH groups in the Fig. 6b Ag–ZnO (10% w/w)
nanocomposite, Fig. 6c Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite, and Fig. 6d ZnO nanorods. The stretching vibration of

–CH was attributed to the transmittance band at 2802 ­cm−1
(Paulkumar et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019). The transmittance bands of the asymmetric stretching vibration –CH3 and
–CH2 groups were observed at 2802 and 2710 ­cm−1, respectively, while the peaks of the N–H (amide II) and vC-N
(amide III) groups were observed at 1591 and 1381 ­cm−1.
The stretching vibrations of C–O stretching cause the band
to appear at 1126 and 1073 ­cm−1 (Abutalib and Rajeh 2020).
The stretching vibrations of C–O were blamed for the band

at 1073 ­cm−1. The transmittance peak at 486 ­cm−1 is also
attributed to Zn–O vibration (Beura et al. 2021).

Raman spectroscopic analysis
The Raman spectra of Ag NPs and Ag–ZnO (10% w/w)
and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposites are exhibited in
Fig. 7a, b, and c, respectively. The characteristic D and G
bands for Ag NPs and Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) and Ag–ZnO
(5% w/w) nanocomposites were observed at 1366, 1386, and
1373 ­cm−1 for D bands and 1586, 1588, and 1586 ­cm−1 for
G bands, respectively. However, the ID/IG ratios of Ag NPs
and Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposites were 0.83, 0.86, and 0.93, respectively(Sang et al.
2017; Hedberg et al. 2021).
The optical phonons of ZnO have modes
A1 + 2B1 + E1 + 2E2 which reveal a wurtzite structure from
the C6v symmetry group. The polar phonons E1 and A1 split
into longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical phonons.
In Raman spectra, the B1 mode is not present. On the other
hand, Nonpolar modes (E2) are Raman active and have two
frequencies: E2 (high) and E2 (low), which correspond to
the vibrations of the oxygen and Zn atoms, respectively.
The obtained peaks (Fig. 7a) are in good agreement with
the ZnO phase. ZnO has a Raman shift of 419 ­cm−1, which
corresponds to the E2 high-frequency mode. The peak at
593 ­cm−1, displayed in E1 (LO) mode, shows the structural
flaws in ZnO. The peak in ZnO nanorods around 1145 ­cm−1
is owing to multiple-phonon scattering; thus, the intensity of
these peaks in Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) and Ag–ZnO (5%) nanocomposites is lower (Chanda et al. 2017; Meti et al. 2018).

which reveals the hydrodynamic diameter of the synthesized
NPs. When light passes through a colloidal solution, it bombards microscopic particles and scatters them in every possible direction (i.e., Rayleigh scattering). Even if the incident
light is monochromatic or non-divergent, like a laser, we see
a fluctuation in the intensity of light. The fluctuation in light
intensity is caused by Brownian motion in solution, which
always occurs. The dimension of a particle can be determined as a result of the Brownian motion of the particle.
Dynamic light scattering, also known as photon correlation
scattering, is a common name for this approach.
DLS analysis reveals the average size of Ag NPs
(Fig. 8a) to be 340.8 nm. The sharp peak of Ag NPs indicates mono-dispersed type of synthesized NPs. Figure 8d
shows the distribution of ZnO nanorods in the size range of
2000–4400 nm. The average particle size of ZnO nanorods
is 3062 nm. Broad size distributions of ZnO nanorods show

their poly-dispersed nature. Figure 8b, c depict the particle size distribution of nanocomposites. As compared to
ZnO nanorods, the particle size of both nanocomposites is
reduced due to milling. The particle size of the Ag–ZnO
(10% w/w) nanocomposite (Fig. 8b) is 105–704 nm. While
the Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite (Fig. 8c) is 143 and
1401 nm. Both nanocomposites are poly-disperse in nature
(Mukherjee et al. 2014).

Zeta potential
The zeta potential in Fig. 9a–d indicates the stability of the
NPs produced. The sample's Zeta potential reveals the colloidal solution’s dispersion stability. It also demonstrates the
NPs mobility. The zeta potential’s higher positive or negative value indicates stability.
The zeta potential of Ag NPs (Fig. 9a) demonstrates that
they have low stability, namely −9.3 mV. The emergence
of negative charge on the surface of Ag NPs might be analyzed. The negative charge on ZnO nanorods (Fig. 9d) is
−30.5 mV. Due to negative–negative repulsion, the high
negative zeta potential (ξ) value supports the long-term stability, good colloidal nature, and high dispersion of ZnO
nanorods. −34.6 mV is the value of the Ag–ZnO (10% w/w)
nanocomposite (Fig. 9b). −30.5 mV for Ag–ZnO (5% w/w)
nanocomposite (Fig. 9c). Figure 9a–d shows the zeta potential of the nanoparticle and nanocomposite acquired through
analysis. A steadier dispersion is predicted by higher zeta
potentials. A value of 40–60 mV suggests excellent nanoparticle stability in most cases (Jyoti et al. 2016; Nagar and
Devra 2019).

Dye degradation
The photocatalytic activity of Ag NPs, ZnO nanorods and
their nanocomposites were studied by mixing them into MB
and CV aqueous dye solution for degradation in the presence
of the sunlight. As the reaction proceeds, the dye solution
gets decolorized. Among all irradiation techniques sunlight
gives faster decolorizing results in the presence of Nanocatalyst and it’s easy to commercialize (Liu et al. 2019a).
Degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye
The absorbance spectrum of MB gives a peak at 663 nm.
We studied the photocatalytic activity of all synthesized
nanomaterials and their composites for MB, in which Ag
NPs shown 83% degradation in 180 min. The percentage
degradation of MB dye solution in presence of Ag NPs is
shown in Fig. 10c. When Ag–ZnO nanocomposite was used
as a catalyst, it shows different activity Ag–ZnO (10% w/w)
nanocomposite and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite
shows 82% and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) 91% of the degradation respectively. Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) nanocomposite takes
165 min for degradation, and after 120 min, the maximum
absorbance value is nearly same. In the case of Ag–ZnO (5%
w/w) nanocomposite the absorbance intensity from 150 to
195 min is almost similar. Figures 11c and 12c show the degradation percentages of Ag–ZnO (10% w/w) nanocomposite
and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite. ZnO photocatalyst
involve 195 min to degrade 96.37% of dye and Fig. 12c indicates the result of dye degradation (%). The plot of ln(A0/At)
versus time (min) gives a straight line passing through the
origin with a positive slope value, and it is known as the
rate constant (k). The k value of Ag NPs is 0.00925 ­min−1,
as shown in Fig. 10b. The k values for Ag–ZnO (10% w/w)
nanocomposite and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite are
0.01242 and 0.01276 ­min−1 respectively and these values
are taken from Figs. 11b and 12b. From Fig. 13b, the calculated k value of ZnO nanorods is 0.01701 ­min−1 (Joseph
and Mathew 2015).

CV is generally used in biology to classify bacteria (Grams
Method). This is also used as an effective medicine in poultry. It is the primary toxic organic dye used in the textile
industry. Pure CV solution shows the absorbance peak at
583 nm. As shown in Fig. 14c, the degradation of CV in
presence of Ag NPs took place in 120 min for 97% of the
degradation, however 70% of the degradation of organic dye
occurred in the first 90 min. The results for Ag–ZnO (10%
w/w) nanocomposite and Ag–ZnO (5% w/w) nanocomposite are identical. As shown in Figs. 15c and 16c, they both
degrade 50% of the dye in 0–15 min and the remaining 83%

The organic pollutant gets adsorbed and reacted on the
surface of the photocatalyst. The resulting superoxide radical
anion (·O2−), Hydroxyl radical (·OH) and hydrogen peroxide
­(H2O2) formation, which are dominant oxidizing species.
This oxidizing species attacks on the surface of the photocatalyst, where the pollutant is adsorbed. The pathway of
photocatalytic reaction is the oxidation of organic pollutants
(as mentioned above) and converting them to green compounds like ­CO2 and ­H2O as shown in Eq. (14).

(14)

The mechanistic pathway of dye degradation is represented in Fig. 18.
Among the synthesized samples, the ZnO nanorods
exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and decolorize the
MB dye. Ag NPs are highly efficient and were observed
to be very active in the degradation of CV dye. Thus, the
photocatalyst could be used to degrade pollutants in water,
especially for the treatment of textile effluents (Marimuthu
et al. 2020).

Ag NPs as nano‑catalyst
A nano-catalyst is a non-directly involved foreign material added to a chemical system. These days, describing
a Nano-catalyst might be as simple as starting with NPs.
When a Nano-catalyst is used in organic transformation reactions, the reaction rate (k) can be increased, and

reactions can also take place at room temperature. In the
chemical manufacturing industry, the reduction process is
critical and vital to organic transformation. Nitro-group
containing aromatic chemicals are of paramount importance due to their high significance in heterocyclic aromatic compound synthesis, pharmaceutical compound
synthesis, agro-chemical synthesis, and so on. In the many
earlier reported papers (Baruah et al. 2013; Deka et al.
2014; Aditya et al. 2017; Liang et al. 2018; Guo et al.
2019) the conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol
by the catalytic reduction reaction is carried out in the
presence of metallic NPs. So, the reduction reaction is
not carried out without a suitable catalyst (Kuroda et al.
2009). Hydrothermally synthesized ZnO nanorods and
their nanocomposites are not ideal for catalytic reduction reactions with a nominal rate constant. However, the
chemically synthesis of metallic NPs is expensive and
also, releases toxic byproducts. We investigated numerous
chemical transformation processes employing biologically
synthesized Ag NPs in the current reaction. This research
work reports excellent catalytic activity for Nitro-group
containing aromatic chemicals. The development of the
reaction is monitored using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer.
Reduction of 4‑Nitrophenol
The freshly prepared 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) solution is
a pale-yellowish coloured that changes to bright yellow with a strong absorbance peak at 400 nm to form
nitrophenolate ion due to the addition of ­NaBH 4 solution (Zhang et al. 2011; Chiou et al. 2013). As the reaction progresses, the functional Nitro (–NO 2) group is

Mechanistic pathway of reduction of 4‑Nitrophenol
reaction
The reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP happens by hydrogenation,
­ aBH4 conwith ­NaBH4 acting as the source of hydrogen. N
tributes to the ionization of H
­ + from water. The reduction
process happens in two stages: hydrogen atom adsorption
and water molecule elimination. A strong repulsive interaction exists between B
­ H4− and 4-NP, making the reduction
process difficult. The solution of N
­ aBH4 and 4-NP is stable
due to electrostatic repulsion between the B
­ H4− and 4-NP.
Only ­NaBH4 stabilizes this solution. When ­NaBH4 is added
to water, ­BH4− ions form, and in the case of metal oxides,
hydrogen moves from ­BH4− to 4-NP. The hydrogenation
catalytic process happens in several ways, depending on the
surface quality of the Nanocatalyst. On the metal NPs surface, which works as a Nanocatalyst, electrons move from

confirmed. A colorless solution with an extra absorbance
peak at 300 nm denotes the Amino (–NH2) group. When
nano-catalyst is added in the reaction system (Fig. 19a),
the peak intensity at 400 nm starts decreasing whereas a
new absorption peak develops at 300 nm within 390 s.
After completion of reaction, almost zero absorbance is
at 400 nm, this means solution is completely decolorized. Further we studied the graph of ln(A 0/A t) versus
time(min.) (Fig. 19b) which gives a straight line passing
from the origin with a slope i.e. rate constant (k), where
A0 is the first absorbance value and At is the absorbance
value at time interval t of the reduction reaction. The calculated value k from the graph is 0.3048 ­min−1. At 323
and 269 nm, two isosbestic (constant wavelength) points
are present, which indicates a (Fig. 19c) clear conversion
(i.e. 95%). The Schematic possible chemical reduction

­BH4− to 4-NP. The O-atom of 4-NP adsorbs one free hydrogen atom in the Nitro group. The cluster is then joined by
another H-atom. This results in a dihydroxyl-like structure.
Following that, 4-NP is synthesized by creating and removing one water molecule by hydroxyl dehydration. Finally,
4-AP is produced (Aditya et al. 2017; Kong et al. 2017;
Elfiad et al. 2018; Baye et al. 2020; Rawat et al. 2021).
Reduction of nitro‑group containing aromatic chemicals
In addition to 4-nitrophenol, many other nitro-groups containing aromatic chemicals are widely used in synthetic
organic chemistry. Taking this into consideration, we
selected three more nitro group containing organic compounds and studied the catalytic efficacy of the synthesized
NPs and nano-composites for organic transformation reactions. The reduction of 2-Nitroaniline (2-NA), 3-Nitroaniline (3-NA) and 4-Nitroaniline (4-NA), over Ag NPs act
as Nano-catalyst, was studied with the unaltered conditions. The absorption peak of the Nitro-group containing
chemicals is at wavelength 413, 363 and 382 nm for 2-NA,
3-NA and 4-NA, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 2-NA,
3-NA and 4-NA are (Figs. 20a, 21a and 22a) analysed using
UV–Vis spectra of the reaction. As the reaction proceeds
the peak intensity reduces that indicates the conversion of
2-NA to 2-aminoaniline (2-AP), 3-NA to 3-aminoaniline
(3-AP) and 4-NA to 4-aminoaniline (4-AP) it takes 12.5,
13- and 11.5-min. time, resp. for complete conversion.
Figures 20b, 21b, and 22b demonstrate the progress of the
reaction. Approximately 95, 75, and 98 percent of the reactant is converted into product during this time. The graph

13

of ln(A0/At) with time (min) (Figs. 20c, 21c, and 22c) shows
that they have a linear relationship. The 2-NA, 3-NA, and
4-NA reduction reactions are examples of first-order reactions with k values of 0.1772, 0.0974, and 0.2519 ­min−1.
Scheme 2, 3, and 4 give the conversion between 2-NA to
2-AP, 3-NA to 3-AP and 4-NA to 4-AP.
As from earlier reports, the reduction reaction of Nitrogroup containing aromatic chemicals occurs at the surface of
Nano-catalyst and the mechanism is Nitro-group containing
aromatic chemicals and N
­ aBH4 which acts as a reducing
agent in the reaction, are attached to the active Nanocatalyst
surface.

Conclusions
The effective biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles
through biogenic routes using Z officinale rhizome extract
took place. ZnO nanomaterials are hydrothermally synthesized. Further, we synthesized the nano-composite materials
using these two nanomaterials. UV–Vis spectroscopy, XRD,
SEM, FE-SEM, Zeta Potential and DLS examinations were
used to analyze the size, shape, stability and structure of synthesized nanomaterials. According to zeta potential investigations, nanomaterials, particularly nanocomposites, show
exceptional stability without the addition of any external
stabilizing agent. These findings show that the NPs produced
are mostly spherical, polydisperse, and biocompatible. The
synthesized NPs are used as a catalyst for chemical reductions. Herein, we successfully reduced different aromatic
compounds containing nitro groups. Further, we tried to

and the nanocomposites exhibited little catalytic efficacy. We
studied the efficacy of synthesized nanomaterials for degradation of organic dyes methylene blue and crystal violet.
The current work offers a new route for very convenient and

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were synthesized by a precipitation method from zinc nitrate hexahydrate
and sodium hydroxide using high-temperature dyeing equipment. This synthesis was studied within the framework of the percent yield to determine the most favorable concentrations of the chemical reagents. The in situ
functionalization of cotton textiles with ZnO NPs was carried out via an exhaust dyeing method using the
previously determined favorable concentrations of zinc nitrate (2, 5, 8 and 10% on-weight-fabric) and sodium
hydroxide (0.7, 1.7, 2.5 and 3.0 g/L). The results demonstrated that the ZnO NPs in powder form and those
synthesized in situ on the fabric exhibited a wurtzite hexagonal crystalline structure. The powder displayed a
star-like morphology with very pronounced sharp points, whereas the NPs grown on the fabric showed a similar
morphology but with not very pronounced sharp points. For all concentrations of zinc nitrate studied, before and
after 20 washing cycles, the cotton fabric functionalized with the ZnO NPs exhibited a UV protection factor
between very good and excellent.

1. Introduction
Small doses of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun help the
human body produce vitamin D and contribute to bone development
[1,2]. Nevertheless, intense and intermittent exposure to UV radiation
can cause acute and chronic eﬀects on the skin, eyes and immune
system as well as melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers [1,3].
Currently, skin cancer is the most common of all human cancers, with
between 2 and 3 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer and
132,000 cases of melanoma detected worldwide each year [4,5]. Occupational sun exposure has a signiﬁcant association with skin cancer
[6,7], and this exposure can occur via direct sunlight, surface reﬂections, and UV light scattered by the atmosphere [8]. Thus, outdoor
workers, such as farmers, plumbers, postal service letter carriers, construction workers, military personnel, gardeners, lumbermen, ﬁshermen, and mountain guides, are vulnerable to skin cancer because they
are exposed to more UV radiation (UVR) for extended periods during
their daily activities [2,9,10]. Reducing the chronic UVR exposure of
outdoor workers through implementation of sun safety practices and/or
sun protection policies can prevent and reduce the incidence of occupational skin cancer [6,8,10,11]. Some of these sun safety practices
⁎

include using shade/cover when working in the sun, wearing sunglasses, minimizing working in direct sunlight during the middle of the
day, using sunscreen, wearing a safety helmet with neck protection and
wearing protective clothing [11,12]. Most textile fabrics and clothing
provide some protection from the sun regardless of whether they have
an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating. The eﬀectiveness of a
textile in reducing the UVR that reaches the skin is determined by
several factors, such as the weave density, fabric construction, fabric
thickness, stretchability, porosity, color, ﬁnishing process and presence
of UV absorbers [13,14]. To enhance the UV protection properties of
fabrics and achieve other functionalities, some researchers have applied
nanoparticles (NPs) to textile fabrics during the ﬁnishing process. The
functionalization of fabrics with SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, ZnO2, CuO and Ag
NPs has gained considerable academic and industrial attention not only
due to the innovative applications of these fabrics, e.g., for repelling
water and oil, reducing static, blocking UV light, resisting microbes,
self-cleaning and resisting wrinkles, but also to meet the growing consumer demand for advanced materials [15–19]. ZnO is an n-type
semiconductor with a wide band gap (3.37 eV) and possesses remarkable properties, such as nontoxicity, biosafety, excellent biocompatibility, chemical stability under exposure to both high temperatures and

synthesis was performed in triplicate. The percent yield of the chemical
reaction between Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH to produce ZnO was determined according to the following stoichiometric equation [33–35]:

UVR, facile fabrication and low-cost production [20,21]. ZnO NPs can
have various morphologies, such as ﬂowers, hexagonal prisms, double
raspberries, double jellyﬁshes, rose-like ﬂowers, and stars, among
others [22–24]. Hezam et al. (2017) researched the mechanism for how
morphology inﬂuences the properties of nanomaterials and reported
that the optical and photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanoﬂores change
with variations in their morphology. Erythemally weighted UV represents the biologically weighted eﬀect of radiation involving UVA or
UVB wavelengths and is determined by integrating the product of the
irradiance and the erythemal weighting functions [25]. The functionalization of cotton fabric with ZnO NPs to improve the ability of the
fabric to block erythemally weighted UVR can be realized by ex situ and
in situ methods. Ex situ methods consist of two steps: (1) the synthesis of
NPs and (2) the application of NPs to the fabric surface [26]. Such
methods, which include homogeneous precipitation, wet chemistry and
hydrothermal methods [27–29] are complex and time consuming. In
situ or one-step methods are characterized by the synthesis of NPs in the
presence of the fabric, for instance, the in situ synthesis of ZnO on cotton
ﬁbers under microwave irradiation [26,30].
In this study, the in situ synthesis of ZnO NPs on woven cotton
fabrics was achieved by an exhaust dyeing method to enhance the
ability of the fabric to block erythemally weighted UVR. The equipment
used, i.e., high-temperature dyeing equipment (HTDE), is currently
indispensable for wet processing throughout the textile industry. The
morphological, structural and molecular vibration characteristics of
ZnO NP powder were determined using scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Cotton fabrics functionalized
with the ZnO NPs were examined using XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); with the last analysis, the concentration of
the ZnO NPs on the cotton fabric was determined. Finally, the UPF
values of the cotton textiles were determined according to AATCC test
method 183-2004 before and after 20 washing cycles, and the wash
cycles were assessed using AATCC test method 61-1996 with procedure
N° 1A.

2.3. Functionalization of the textile fabrics with the ZnO NPs
The in situ synthesis of the ZnO NPs on the cotton fabric was conducted via an exhaust dyeing method using the HTDE. Chemical concentrations were produced in a shorter range than those used for the
synthesis of the ZnO NPs. The Zn(NO3)2·6H2O concentrations used were
2, 5, 8 and 10% owf and those of NaOH were 0.7, 1.6, 2.5 and 3.0 g/L.
The ready-to-dye cotton fabric was prewashed with 2 g/L of nonionic
detergent at 98 °C for 20 min to obtain a fabric free of impurities and
with good hydrophilicity. The fabric was rinsed well with distilled
water at 60 °C. An exhaustion bath at an LR of 10:1 was prepared from
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O Five grams of fabric were immersed in a 50-mL exhaustion bath in a steel beaker; the beaker was then closed and placed
in the HTDE. The solution remained under constant stirring at 40 rpm
for 90 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 50 mL of the NaOH
solution was added to the steel beaker such that the volume increased
to 100 mL; therefore, the LR was changed to 20:1. The steel beaker was
again placed inside the HTDE and stirred for 30 min at 90 °C. Then, the
cotton fabric was neutralized with 0.5 g/L acetic acid, washed with
distilled water and dried at 80 °C in a Mathis DH-E laboratory dryer,
Brazil. The aforementioned functionalization process is similar to a
procedure presented by Amézquita [36].
2.4. Blocking of erythemally weighted UVR using functionalized cotton
fabrics
An in vitro method was applied to evaluate the ability of the functionalized cotton fabric to block erythemally weighted UVR according
to the AATCC 183-2004 standard [37] with slight modiﬁcations. UPF
measurements were obtained using a CAMSPEC-M550 UV–VIS spectrophotometer in the wavelength range 280–400 nm, and UPF values
were calculated using M550 sun protection factor (SPF) measurement
system software. Before the measurements, the fabric was conditioned
at 23 °C and 83% relative humidity for 24 h. A 5 × 5 cm2 sample of the
conditioned fabric was placed into the sample compartment of the
spectrophotometer, which was previously calibrated with an Optima
surface. The fabric sample was scanned three times with rotation of 45°
each time. The resultant UPF values were recorded as the average of
these three scans.
The UPF value indicates how much UVR can be blocked by clothing
[30,38]. The Australian/New Zealand standard (AS/NZS 4399:1996)
classiﬁes the UPF ratings of fabrics into three major categories
(Table 1).

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Analytical-grade zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA. The material used to achieve textiles with UV protection was a 100% cotton fabric (twill weave, weight: 308 g/m2, warp:
30 threads/cm, weft: 18 threads/cm) obtained from a local fabric store.
Other chemicals and equipment used in this study are described in the
following subsections.
2.2. Synthesis of the ZnO NPs
The ZnO NPs were synthesized according to the procedure reported
by Lanje et al. [31] with modiﬁcations. The NPs were synthetized via a
precipitation method using Mathis ALT-I HTDE to simulate a dyeing
process with ﬁxed parameters, including the temperature, time, pH,
rotation speed, pressure and liquor ratio (LR); the ratio between the
dye-bath volume used and the weight of the treated textile is denoted
by LR [32] but without the presence of the textile. Aqueous solutions
were prepared with 2.0–40.0% on-weight-fabric (owf) Zn(NO3)2·6H2O
and 0.4–3.3 g/L of NaOH, as if the fabric weight was 5.0 g and the LR
was 10:1. Subsequently, 50 mL samples of the aforementioned solutions
were mixed and added to a 120-mL steel beaker; the beaker was then
placed in the HTDE and constantly stirred at 40 rpm for 30 min at 90 °C.
After this period, the resultant solution remained at rest for 12 h to
ensure greater ZnO NP precipitation. After the supernatant was decanted, the ZnO NPs were dried at 80 °C for 20 h and then weighed. Each

2.5. Wash durability test
The AATCC test method 61-1996 with procedure N° 1A with some
modiﬁcations was used to evaluate the wash durability of the functionalized cotton fabric [39]. The procedure included ﬁrst preparing the
wash solution by dissolving 3.7 g of a standard reference detergent

because of the law of deﬁnite proportions, or Proust's law, which dictates that every chemical compound contains ﬁxed and constant proportions (by mass) of its constituent elements [40]. This relation indicates that the total consumption of the limiting reagent will limit the
production of ZnO NPs and, therefore, the percent yield. However, the
highest reaction yields were clearly obtained with 5–10% owf Zn
(NO3)2.6H2O for all three of the investigated NaOH concentrations.
Thus, we designed new experiments to study the eﬀects of the limiting
reagent concentration on the reaction yield, and another series of reactions was performed while keeping the Zn(NO3)2.6H2O concentration
constant (Fig. 2).
The results of the chemical reaction between 2% owf Zn
(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.5–1.3 g/L NaOH are shown in Fig. 2a. The curve in
this ﬁgure shows that, as the NaOH concentration was increased from
0.5 to 0.7 g/L, the reaction yield increased, reaching a maximum value
of 88.4%. Nevertheless, with a steady increase in the NaOH concentration, the yield curve began to decrease, achieving a percent yield
as low as 63.9% at 1.3 g/L NaOH. This decrease may be associated with
the excess NaOH present in the reaction, which could produce more
aqueous sodium nitrate (NaNO3) than solid ZnO due to a secondary
chemical reaction. Meanwhile, Fig. 2b–d show the chemical reaction
yield of 5, 8 and 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O with 1.2–2.0, 2.0–2.8 and
2.4–3.3 g/L NaOH, respectively. As shown in these three ﬁgures, the
yield increased gradually as a result of the increased NaOH concentration, reaching a percent yield of 97.3% (Fig. 2b), 97.4% (Fig. 2c)
and 98.9% (Fig. 2d) with 1.7, 2.5 and 3.0 g/L NaOH, respectively. For
subsequent NaOH concentrations, the yields for the three Zn
(NO3)2·6H2O concentrations analyzed remained relatively constant.
Thus, in the study carried out to determine the formation parameters of ZnO NPs, the following maximum yields were obtained:
88.4%; 97.3%; 97.4% and 98.9% for the chemical reaction of 2, 5, 8
and 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O with 0.7, 1.7, 2.5 and 3.0 g/L NaOH,
respectively. The cotton fabric was subsequently functionalized with
these favorable concentrations, as detailed in Section 2.3.
Fig. 3 shows the UPF values of the nonfunctionalized and functionalized cotton fabrics evaluated according to AATCC 183-2004 standard. The UPF of nonfunctionalized fabric is 19.7, which is good
(Table 1, UPF ≤ 15). This result can be related to the fabric construction and weight. A fabric of twill construction is distinguished by diagonal lines; the simplest twill consists of the crossing of weft yarn over
two warp yarns, then under one warp yarn. This fabric has less space
between the yarns (porosity) and therefore provides greater UV protection. Weight is another factor responsible for the increase in UV
protection. Heavy fabrics have lower porosity and consequently provide
better UV protection [14]. When the twill fabric was functionalized
with ZnO NPs using the minimum concentration of 2% owf Zn
(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.7 g/L NaOH, the UPF value increased from 19.7 to
47.0. This increase of approximately 140% might be due to the incorporation of nanometric ZnO particles onto the cotton surface, which
enhanced the absorption of UV light [15]. The UPF value was further
increased when the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O concentration was increased during
the functionalization process (the UPF increased linearly). This eﬀect is
attributed to the increased ZnO concentration in the fabric. In all of the
functionalized fabrics, the ZnO NPs provided an excellent level of UV
protection (UPF ≥ 40). Thus, the functionalization process via exhaust
dyeing substantially improved the UV protection of the textile.
After evaluation of the UPF values of the cotton fabrics with and
without ZnO NP functionalization, the resistance of the fabric to domestic washing cycles was tested according to the AATCC 61-1996
standard. The UPF values of the cotton fabrics after 20 washing cycles
are shown in Fig. 4. A 10% increase in the UPF value of the nonfunctionalized fabric was observed after 20 washes. According to Kozlowski [41], wet processes promote alterations in the fabric dimensions and increase the yarn density due to fabric shrinkage, and this
eﬀect is directly reﬂected in the UV protection properties. With the
washing process, shrinkage of the cotton fabric occurs, resulting in a

without an optical brightener (WOB) in 1 L of distilled water. Then,
200 mL of the prepared wash solution was transferred to a 500-mL steel
beaker. Each beaker contained 10 stainless steel balls to simulate the
friction normally present during the washing process. The fabric was
then placed into the steel beaker, and the beaker was closed and placed
inside the HTDE. The HTDE maintained a constant rotation speed of
40 rpm for 45 min at 40 °C. At the end of the washing processes, the
cotton fabric was rinsed three times with distilled water at 40 ± 3 °C
for 1 min and dried at 70 °C.
2.6. Structural and morphological characterization of ZnO NPs and
functionalized cotton fabric
The functional groups present in the ZnO NP powder were analyzed
by FTIR in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 using a PerkinElmer Spectrum
One spectrophotometer. XRD analysis of the ZnO NP powder and cotton
fabric was performed using a Philips X’Pert PRO PW 3040/00 diffractometer (Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å), 45 kV at 40 mA, 20 ≤ 2θ ≤ 70°) and a
Bruker D8 Advance diﬀractometer (Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å), 40 kV at
40 mA, 20 ≤ 2θ ≤ 60° and 30 ≤ 2θ ≤ 40°), respectively. The morphology of the ZnO NPs was observed by STEM via a cold-ﬁeld-emission
Hitachi SU8230 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of
30 kV. For the cotton fabric functionalized with ZnO NPs, morphological and chemical analyses were performed via SEM and EDS, respectively, using an FEI Quanta 600 FEG microscope and a Hitachi
SU8230 ﬁeld-emission electron microscope. TGA was performed under
a nitrogen atmosphere using a TA Instruments Q500; approximately
10.0 mg of fabric was heated from 25 to 950 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.
3. Results and discussion
To understand the inﬂuence of the concentration of both NaOH and
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O on the percent yield of the ZnO NPs, a systematic series
of chemical reactions was performed. Fig. 1 shows the percent yield of
the chemical reaction between 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g/L NaOH with 5, 10,
20, 30 and 40% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O These trials revealed that the yield
rapidly decreased with increasing Zn(NO3)2.6H2O concentration. For
20% owf Zn(NO3)2.6H2O, the yield approached 8%, 12% and 18% for
0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g/L NaOH, respectively. The reaction yield remained
relatively constant at higher Zn(NO3)2.6H2O concentrations. The
aforementioned behavior and the low percent yield of all reactions (not
greater than 60%) can be attributed to the fact that NaOH, as the
limiting reagent, is consumed more rapidly than Zn(NO3)2.6H2O

with the ZnO NPs but without the presence of fabric, as described in
Section 2.2) and the cotton fabrics functionalized with these NPs, 10%
owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH were selected as representative
concentrations due to the high percent yield and UPF value.
The FTIR spectrum of the ZnO NP powder synthesized using 10%
owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH is shown in Fig. 5. The broad
bands observed between 3000 and 3700 cm−1 correspond to the O–H
stretching modes of water present in the ZnO; the bands at 1634 cm−1
and 1398 cm−1 are associated with the O–H bending modes of water
molecules [28,35,45]. The band in the region from 600 to 400 cm−1 is
attributed to the Zn–O stretching vibration mode; thus, the band at
500 cm−1 conﬁrms the presence of ZnO NPs [31,35,46].

peaks of the wurtzite structure (hexagonal phase) of ZnO are observed.
All peaks observed for the ZnO NP powder are in good agreement with
card No. 36-1451 of the International Center of Diﬀraction Data (ICDD)
database. The major diﬀraction peaks are located at 2θ = 31.8°, 34.5°
and 36.3°, which correspond to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) crystalline
planes, respectively [28,47]. The grain size of the ZnO NPs was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer formula [48], and the mean size was
approximately 25 nm. In addition, the pattern shows intense and broad
diﬀraction peaks, clearly indicating the small grain size of the ZnO NPs
[49]. Hence, the results obtained by XRD and FTIR show that the
method employed to synthesize NPs using the HTDE is eﬀective for
producing pure ZnO NPs. XRD analysis was used to corroborate the
presence of ZnO on the textile substrates. Fig. 6b presents the XRD
pattern of the nonfunctionalized fabric. The two peaks at 22.9° (0 0 2)
and 34.7° (0 4 0) correspond to cellulose I (native cellulose) [50,51].
Fig. 6c shows the diﬀractograms in the 30–40° range for the fabric with
and without ZnO NP functionalization. In this range, the pattern of the
fabric functionalized with 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH
shows clear peaks at angles of approximately 32°, 34° and 36° assigned
to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) planes of the ZnO phase [52,53], as
shown in Fig. 6a. These peaks do not appear in the diﬀractogram of the
nonfunctionalized fabric (Fig. 6b). Moreover, the pattern for the fabric
functionalized with 5% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.7 g/L NaOH displays
only a small diﬀraction peak that corresponds to the (1 0 1) plane of the
ZnO phase. These results conﬁrm the presence of ZnO on the cotton
fabric surface after functionalization via exhaust dyeing. Even more, for
the fabric functionalized with 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L
NaOH, after 20 washes, the ZnO NPs are still present, as displayed in
Fig. 7 from the XRD analysis. Although the intensity of the peaks
(1 0 0), (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) is lower than that for the case of the fabric
without washing, we conﬁrmed that the protection of textiles after

reduction in the pore size of the fabric between the warp and weft
yarns. Moreover, Kan and Au reported that the UPF increase is directly
related to a decrease in the fabric porosity [42], which conﬁrms our
results obtained for the nonfunctionalized fabric. For the functionalized
cotton fabrics, repeated washing resulted in UV protection that was
reduced by a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 61%. This reduction
was likely caused by a decrease in the concentration of ZnO NPs on the
fabric surface due to friction produced by the steel balls during
washing. In addition, the loss of functionality or ﬁnishing after wash
cycles is a behavior usually observed in textiles ﬁnished with commercial products [43,44], and fabrics functionalized with NPs are not
an exception. The horizontal dashed line drawn at value 50 in Fig. 4
highlights the maximum UPF rating. According to the AS/NZS 23991996 standard, fabrics with a UPF value greater than ﬁfty can be labeled only as 50+ [38]. Thus, despite the postwashing reduction in the
UPF of the fabrics functionalized with ZnO NPs synthesized with 5, 8
and 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.7, 2.5, and 3.0 g/L NaOH, respectively, the fabrics continued to provide suﬃcient UV protection to
shield human skin from UVR. Additionally, for fabric functionalized
with ZnO NPs with 2% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.7 g/L NaOH, the UV
protection category changed from excellent to very good.
For subsequent characterization of the ZnO NP powder (synthesized
via exactly the same conditions used for the functionalization of fabrics

Becheri et al. and Mohamed et al. [58,59]. However, the increase in the
percentage of functionalized fabric ash residue suggests the presence of
not only carbon but also ZnO, which is stable at room temperature and
exhibits high thermal stability [30,60] and was applied to the cotton
fabric, as conﬁrmed by XRD, SEM and EDS analyses, as previously
discussed. Thus, to calculate the amount of ZnO NPs present in the 5 g
of cotton fabric after functionalization, the ash percentage after thermal
treatment of the functionalized and nonfunctionalized cotton was
compared, yielding a calculated mass for the ZnO NPs of 0.0990 mg.
This mass represents approximately 2% of the fabric weight and 73% of
the total amount of ZnO NP powder that was synthesized using the
HTDE with 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH at a reaction
yield of 98.9% (Fig. 2d). The cotton fabric was functionalized with ZnO
NPs via exhaust dyeing; according to Oliveira et al. (2016), the amount
of dye directly lost in wastewater depends on the type of dye, and this
amount can range from 2% to 50% of the initial dye concentration [61].
Based on this study and assuming that ZnO represents a type of dye,
27% of the remaining ZnO NPs may have been lost in the wastewater of
the exhaustion and neutralization baths and rinse water. This level of
NP loss would be within the range of the percentage of dye that is
usually lost in wet textile processes.

washing is associated with the presence of ZnO.
Fig. 8 shows STEM micrographs of the ZnO NP powder synthesized
using 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH. According to Rezaie
et al. [54], the NP shape results from aggregation or agglomeration,
indicating that NPs can grow together to form diﬀerent particles with a
high surface area via irregular agglomeration. Fig. 8a shows an agglomeration of ZnO NPs to form a star-like shape [55]. These stars are
formed by six sharp points extending radially from a central axis; the
shape has a diameter and axis length of approximately 0.5 and 1 μm,
respectively. Fig. 8b shows the same image at a higher magniﬁcation,
clearly showing the star-shape of the particle.
The cotton fabrics were observed via FESEM to study the distribution and morphology of the ZnO NPs on the cotton surface. Micrographs
of the nonfunctionalized fabric and fabric functionalized with ZnO NPs
synthesized with 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH are illustrated in Fig. 9. The nonfunctionalized ﬁbers exhibit a smooth appearance (Fig. 9a), while the functionalized ﬁbers show ZnO NPs,
which appear to be heterogeneously distributed, on their surfaces
(Fig. 9b). The accumulation of ZnO NPs on the ﬁbers is clearly shown in
Fig. 9c. The FESEM micrographs in Fig. 9d show the agglomeration of
ZnO NPs with structures similar to a star with a diameter of approximately 0.6 μm but with fewer protruding points and a smaller overall
size than the ZnO NP powder obtained in the HTDE (Fig. 8). The observed diﬀerences in the morphology of the ZnO NPs might be due to
the presence of cotton fabric in the exhaustion bath, which could
modify the ZnO growth kinetics. In addition to these results, Fig. 10
shows the FESEM micrographs of functionalized cotton fabric with 10%
owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH after 20 washing cycles. The
Fig. 10a and b suggest that the ZnO NPs with star appearances continue
on the cotton ﬁber surface but are less abundant than those previously
observed on fabrics with no washing process. Therefore, these micrographs agree with information reported in Fig. 7.
The chemical composition of the cotton fabric functionalized with
ZnO NPs was determined using EDS analysis; the results are shown in
Fig. 11. The functionalized cotton fabric is composed of C, O and Zn.
The C and O are related to the cellulose of the cotton, whereas the Zn is
due to the presence of the ZnO NPs. The elemental Pt observed in the
spectrum is related to the platinum coating applied to the surface of the
fabric before analysis.
To determine the amount of ZnO NPs on the fabric surface after the
functionalization process, TGA was performed. The TGA results for the
nonfunctionalized fabric and fabric functionalized with ZnO NPs synthesized with 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.0 g/L NaOH are shown in
Fig. 12. In the thermogravimetric curve for the nonfunctionalized
cotton fabric (Fig. 12a), the ﬁrst weight loss below 200 °C is likely associated with the evaporation of water molecules [56]; in this region,
the greatest loss occurred before 100 °C. In addition, the type of water
molecules present in the textile will inﬂuence their thermal behavior.
Water molecules superﬁcially absorbed by the cotton fabric will evaporate at temperatures below 100 °C, whereas water molecules that
have interacted with the –OH functional groups in the cotton will
evaporate at higher temperatures. A second weight loss occurred in the
temperature range from 250 to 400 °C due to the formation of ﬂammable volatiles and aliphatic char; with increasing temperature, this
carbon subsequently oxidized, producing carbon monoxide (CO) and
carbon dioxide (CO2) [57]. The thermal oxidation of nonfunctionalized
cotton showed a maximum decomposition temperature of 374.4 °C,
leaving 5.3% ash at a temperature of 950 °C. As shown in Fig. 12b, the
thermal behavior of the functionalized fabric was similar to that of the
nonfunctionalized fabric but with a maximum decomposition temperature of 372.6 °C and 7.3% residual ash at 950 °C. The diﬀerence in
the maximum decomposition temperature between the nonfunctionalized and functionalized fabric was ∼2 °C. This minimal difference in decomposition temperature is because the treatment of the
cotton fabric with ZnO NPs does not substantially alter the thermal
stability or maximum pyrolysis temperature of cotton, as reported by

4. Conclusion
ZnO NP powder was synthesized via a precipitation method using
HTDE and used to determine the favorable concentrations of Zn
(NO3)2·6H2O (2, 5, 8 and 10% owf) and NaOH (0.7, 1.7, 2.5 and 3.0 g/
L). The in situ functionalization of the cotton fabric with ZnO NPs was
obtained via exhaust dyeing using the determined favorable concentrations of the chemical reagents. The FTIR spectra of the ZnO NP
powder exhibited stretching vibrations for the Zn–O bonds at
500 cm−1. Additionally, XRD analysis of the ZnO NP powder and the
fabric functionalized with ZnO indicated a hexagonal wurtzite structure, thus conﬁrming the presence of ZnO on the cotton fabric before
and after washing; this result was supported by the EDS analysis results.
In terms of morphology, the ZnO NP powder and the ZnO NPs on the
cotton fabric exhibited a star shape with diﬀerent sizes. Considering the
98.9% percent yield for the reaction of 10% owf Zn(NO3)2·6H2O with
3.0 g/L NaOH, the amount of ZnO NPs on the functionalized textile was
1.4% of the total fabric weight. Finally, all cotton fabrics functionalized
with the ZnO NPs exhibited very good and/or excellent UV protection,
even after 20 washing cycles. The obtained fabrics could be applied in
sun safety practices for outdoor workers.

Coating of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles on cotton fabric
Madheswaran Balamurugan , Shanmugam Saravanan, Tetsuo Soga

 American Coatings Association 2017
Abstract Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by a
green method and coated on cotton fabric using dip
and ultrasonication processes. The synthesized silver
nanoparticles were characterized using ultraviolet visible spectra, X-ray diffractometry and transmission
electron microscopy. Through transmission electron
microscopy, the nanostructure was confirmed. The
prepared silver nanoparticles were about 86 nm in size
with a face-centered cubic crystalline nature. The
silver nanoparticles coated on cotton fabric were
characterized using a scanning electron microscope.
The scanning electron microscope images showed
uniform coating of silver nanoparticles on the surface
of fabrics. The antibacterial activities of the silver
nanoparticle-coated fabric were investigated against
the strain of Staphylococcus aureus culture, and it
exhibited good antibacterial activity. The tensile
strength of the cotton fabric increased considerably
when the silver nanoparticles were coated on it. The
ultrasonication process gave rise to the higher tensile
strength.

Introduction
Currently, nanoparticles are used in numerous industrial applications including textiles. The preparation of
nanomaterials and their immobilization on fabric are
active areas of academic and textile industry research.1
Surface modification or immobilization with nanoparticles brings forth some advantageous properties such
as water resistance, self-cleaning,2 odor and moisture
elimination,2 bacterial resistance,3 and UV light protection4 to the fabric. When the conducting inorganic
nanomaterials are coated on fabric or even a sheet of
paper, they acquire new properties such as electrical
conductivity. These coated materials are cost-effective
and versatile materials for making various electronic
devices such as solar cells, sensors, electromagnetic
interference shielding, electronic sensors, microwave
absorption, heat generation, and microelectronics.5–8
Different types of materials and coating methods are
used to enhance the multifunctional properties of a
fabric. However, some of these modifications often
damage the primary as well as secondary properties of
the fabric. Gorle et al.9 prepared a silver-coated cotton
fabric with high electrical conductivity and silver
surface area. It was reported that the silver-coated
cotton fabric could be used for sulfide detection/monitoring applications by investigating the electrochemical contact between silver-coated cotton fabric and
glassy carbon substrate in aqueous phosphate buffer
media (with and without sulfide). The coloration
process also could be improved by using eco-friendly
materials. Gashti et al.10 used bentonite-type clay as a
nanoadsorbent and as a promising eco-friendly substitute for mordants in the natural dyeing of wool with
madder. The results showed that the color strength of
the dyed samples improved with an increase in the
amount of clay. Various materials having multifunctional properties are prepared to modify the fabric
surface. A ternary nanocomposite substance consisting

J. Coat. Technol. Res.

of clay-Ag-polypyrrole was prepared by chemical
reduction and photoreduction. This synthetic substance
could be used to impart/enhance the multifunctional
properties of fabric.11 Electromagnetic shielding was
imparted to a fabric by coating immobilized Fe-pillared
clay (Fe-PILC) nanoparticles using the pad-dry method under ultraviolet irradiation. Fe-PILC also enhanced the effective absorption capabilities of cotton
textiles.12 The thermal stability of the cotton fiber was
improved by embedding silica–kaolinite or nano-ZrO2
on the fabric surface using succinic acid as a crosslinking agent and sodium hypophosphite as a catalyst.13,14
Wool fabric was crosslinked with nano-ZrO2 to attain
its self-cleaning capability. ZrO2 activated the photodegradation process of methyl blue due to the
production of ÆOH radicals under UV irradiation.14 In
addition, wool stabilized with nanozirconia particles
decreased the average contact angles of water and
increased the electromagnetic reflectivity.15 A cationic

technique
and
polyvinylphosphonic acid as an anionic thermal-resistant substance. It improved the thermal stability and
hydrophobicity of cotton. Moreover, graphene and
polyvinylphosphonic acid protected the cotton from
solar ultraviolet rays and near-infrared reflectivity. The
electrical conductivity and electromagnetic shielding
properties were also improved.16 Gashti et al.17 improved the electromagnetic shielding property and
thermal stability of wool by coating polypyrrole/silver
nanocomposites by a single-step UV-induced polymerization process. The dyeability of cotton could be
increased by nanoclay pretreatment. The pretreatment
of nanoclay minerals increased the adsorption and
fixation of dyes (»5–15%) resulting in a lower load of
dyes in the effluent. On the other hand, an efficient and
reproducible dyeing process could be accomplished by
a lower consumption of dyes with less timing (»10–
20%) of dyeing process due to their high capacity for
dye adsorption.18 The breathability of the textile fibers
is one of the important factors for human comfort. It is
defined as the moisture transport from the skin to the
outer environment through textile. Breathability could
be improved by coating the wool fiber with colloidal
clay.19 Currently, without any toxicity to humans and
the environment, low cost, antimicrobial finishing is
one of the most popular finishes practiced in the textile
industry.3 Al-doped ZnO/Ag/AZO and Al-doped
ZnO/Cu/AZO multilayer-deposited (radio frequency
magnetron sputtering technology) polyester fabrics
have good hydrophobic properties, a high IR reflection
rate, and excellent UV protection with the highest air
permeability reduction.20,21 Moreover, Ag- and Aldoped ZnO/Ag/AZO ceramic films deposited on cotton fabrics provide excellent UV radiation protection
and infrared reflective properties, which make them
promising materials for solar control applications.22
The Ag-coated polyester fabrics also show ultraviolet
protection, water repellency, durability, and good hand
feel with highest reduction rate of air permeability.23

Among various materials, silver nanoparticles (Ag
NPs) are one of the most versatile materials for surface
modification.
The Ag NP is a well-known effective antibacterial
agent, which is commonly used in various commercial
products including in the textile industry to avoid
microbial contamination. Many researchers have recommended Ag NPs as superior disinfectants for steer
clear or to prevent microorganisms such as fungi,
viruses, and bacteria on fabric. Ag NP-coated fabric
strongly decreases the wound dressing. Ag NPs act as
powerful antimicrobial agents against nearly 650
strains of bacteria. They are more reactive with
proteins. When they come into contact with the
bacteria or fungi, they inhibit the cell growth and
multiplication, owing to the fact that Ag affects the
cellular metabolism. In addition, they suppress the
respiration system of microorganisms.24 There are
various physical and chemical methods involving
different chemicals available for the preparation of
Ag NPs. Nanoparticles, prepared using different
methods, show different physical–chemical properties.25–27 In the chemical synthesis method, toxic
chemicals are used and may create side effects in
humans and in the environment. Nowadays, various
methods such as screen printing, padding squeezing,28
spray, sonochemical,3 and dip coating have been used
for the surface modification of fabric with nanoparticles. For enhancing the adsorption and stability of
nanoparticles on fabric, various binding chemicals
have been used in the coating process.29 It is
important that the synthesized NPs should be
stable in the colloidal form and also in the metallic
state. These parameters are taken into account for
coating purposes.28 The researchers focus their attention mainly on the preparation of stable Ag NPs and
controlling their size without using any toxic chemicals. In the present study, green-synthesized nanoparticles were used. This avoided the use of chemically
synthesized nanoparticles, and thus their side effects
were eliminated. In this green synthesis method, no
toxic chemicals were used30,31 and the Ag NPs were
obtained in colloidal form. In this study, Peltophorum
pterocarpum flower extract was used as a nontoxic
reducing and binding agent in the Ag NPs synthesis
protocol and the green-synthesized Ag NPs were
coated on cotton fabric without any binder, using
simple dip and ultrasonication methods.

Experimental
Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3) analytical grade was purchased
from Merck & Co. and used without further purification. Cotton fabric of specifications ends/inch-54, picks/
inch-44, warp count-20 s Ne, weft count-20 s Ne, and
GSM-125 gm was purchased from local industry. The

J. Coat. Technol. Res.

The silver nanoparticles were prepared according to
the previous report.32,33 In the typical preparation of
plant extract, about 1 g of fresh P. pterocarpum flowers
was washed with de-ionized water to remove the
adhering soil and dust. The washed flowers were boiled
in 100 mL of de-ionized water at 80C for 20 min and
then filtered to separate them from the broth. The
obtained extract was stored at 4C to avoid any form of
contamination. To synthesize the silver nanoparticles,
20 mL of the prepared P. pterocarpum flower extract
was dripped into 100 mL of 0.01 M aqueous silver
nitrate (aq. AgNO3) solution with constant stirring at
room temperature to reduce the Ag+ into Ag0.
Coating of silver nanoparticles on fabric
The cotton fabric was made into 2 9 2 cm2 square
pieces and immersed in the prepared colloidal Ag NPs
solution and kept for 24 h at dark. In another study,
ultrasonication (Cyberlab, CB2020, and ultrasonic80 W/46 kHz) was performed for 30 min. The treated
cotton fabric was washed with ethanol followed by deionized water several times to remove the extra and
unspent Ag NPs. The washed fabric was dried at 60C
and then characterized.
Characterization
The tensile properties of Ag NP-coated fabric were
determined by the strip method (IS EN ISO 29073) on
a tensile strength testing machine, ZWICK 1445
(Zwick GmbH & Co., Germany). Fabric samples of
100 9 10 mm size were prepared for the tensile
strength test. Samples were tested at R.H. 65 ± 2%
and 21 ± 1C. The rate of traverse was 10 mm/min.
The electrical conductivity of silver nanoparticlescoated fabric was measured using an LCR Z
(TH2816A) meter from 50 Hz to 200 kHz at room
temperature.
Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticlesincorporated fabric
Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticle-coated
cotton fabric was studied by disk diffusion method.4,32
A Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus (S.
aureus), was used as the testing organism. Pure cultures
were subcultured in Muller-Hinton broth for 24 h at
37C. The subcultured organism was swabbed uniformly on a plate using sterile cotton swabs. The Ag
NP-coated and uncoated fabrics were gently placed on

Results and discussions
Silver nanoparticles were prepared using P. pterocarpum flower extract as the reducing and capping/
binding agent. After adding the P. pterocarpum plant
extract into aqueous AgNO3 solution, a visible color
change was observed as the colorless solution changed
to yellowish brown and then dark brown which
indicated the formation of Ag NPs. The color change
is the most commonly used indicator for the formation
of metal nanoparticles.34 The intensity of color
increased with time indicating adequate growth of
nanoparticles. The optical property of Ag NPs was
studied with the UV–Vis double-beam bio-spectrophotometer (ELICO-BL 198) in the wavelength range of
300–800 nm. Ultraviolet visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy was used for primary characterization35 to
study the reduction in Ag ions from aqueous AgNO3
solution to Ag NPs and optical properties.36 The UV–
Vis spectra showed a sharp peak in the visible region
around 440 nm, as shown in Fig. 1. This was due to
surface plasmon excitation, and it confirmed the
formation of Ag NPs. Complete reduction in AgNO3
to Ag NPs was confirmed by the change in color from
colorless to colloidal brown.37 Moreover, the formation
of Ag NPs was confirmed using UV–Vis spectroscopy.23 The intensity of UV–Vis absorbance
increased with the formation of silver nanoparticles.23
After completion of silver nanoparticles formation, the
intensity remained constant. Figure 1 shows the UV–
Vis absorbance spectra of silver nanoparticles after

completion of silver nanoparticles formation. The
structural characterization of the Ag NPs was performed using Powder X-ray diffractometry (SEIFERT,
XRD with Cu-Ka radiation, k = 1.540598 Å) analysis.
Figure 2 depicts the XRD pattern of prepared Ag
NPs. The XRD pattern shows the peaks at 2h angles of
around 38.8, 39.9, 46.0, 52.7, and 61.0 which
correspond to (111), (102), (420), (104), and (531) as
face-centered cubic crystal planes, respectively. The
Ag NPs were analyzed under a transmission electron
microscope (FEI, Tecnai F20) to know morphologies
and nanostructures. The TEM image (Fig. 3) shows
clearly the morphology of Ag NPs and their dispersion.
The plant molecules served as capping agents. A
capping agent is also called a stabilizing or productive
agent. The median diameter of Ag NPs as measured
from TEM images was about 86 nm.
Cotton fabric is a rough, porous substrate made by
micrometer-sized cellulose fibers aligned perpendicular
to each other. Figure 4 shows the optical microscope
image of a single cotton yarn. From the image, the
diameter of the single cotton yarn was deduced as
200 lm. The cotton fabric substrate was coated with
green-synthesized Ag NPs by immersion and ultrasonication. To incorporate the Ag NPs onto fabric, the
fabric was immersed into a well-stabilized colloidal Ag
NPs solution prepared from 0.01 M aqueous AgNO3
and 20 ml of P. pterocarpum flower extract at room
temperature. In the second study, after immersion of
fabric, the ultrasonication was carried out for 30 min.
After completing the treatment, the fabric was washed
several times with ethanol followed by de-ionized
water to remove the excess plant extract and unspent
nanoparticles. The Ag NPs were adsorbed on the
surface of the cotton fabric. The incorporation of Ag
NPs on the cotton fabric was ensured by assessing the
color change in the fabric and measuring the reflectance spectra at wavelengths of 350–800 nm. The
uncoated (pristine) cotton fabric changed its color

from white to brown after treating it with greensynthesized Ag NPs, which indicated the formation of
Ag NPs on the surface of the cotton fabric. Figure 5a
shows the uncoated cotton fabric. Figures 5b and 5c
show the Ag NPs-coated by dip and ultrasonication
process, respectively. The results showed a visible color
difference between uncoated and Ag NP-coated cotton
fabric as shown in Fig. 5. The thickness of coating was
controlled by shorter exposure times or nanoparticle
concentrations. The colorfulness of fiber could be
achieved by coating with anisotropic silver nanoparticles. Different morphologies of silver nanoparticles
produced different colors to the fiber, because of
changes in the localized surface plasmon resonance of
the nanoparticles. In addition, mixing of different silver

nanoparticles in different proportions extended the
range of colors. This could be achieved at room
temperature.38 One of the objectives of this study
was to investigate the interaction between the cotton
fabric surface and the metallic silver nanoparticles.
There are two possibilities available for adsorption of
nanoparticles, that is, the formation of chemical bonds
between the silver and alcoholic or functional group of
cotton and physical adsorption of Ag NPs on the fabric
surface.3
The incorporation of silver nanoparticles on cotton
fabric was confirmed by assessing the color change in
the fabric and measuring the UV–Vis spectra (Shimadzu 3101 PC) in the wavelength range of 350–
800 nm. Figure 6 shows the UV–Vis of the silver
nanoparticle-coated and uncoated cotton fabrics. Surface plasmon resonance peak observed in the UV–Vis
spectrometric graph indicated the adhesion of silver
nanoparticles. The broad nature of the band of silver

nanoparticles-coated sample depicts the wider size
distribution due to aggregated particles as well as range
of particle sizes. Figure 6a shows the reflectance curves
of silver nanoparticle-coated and uncoated fabric.
From the spectra, it is gathered that the uncoated
specimen showed comparably higher reflectance values
ranging from 80 to 90%. For the silver nanoparticlescoated sample, the reflectance value was decreased to
10–50%, due to the decrement of refractive index and
the surface roughness of the fabric. The cotton fabric
which was coated by the ultrasonication process
showed the least reflectance among other samples. It
transpired that a higher amount of silver nanoparticles
was incorporated by ultrasonication method. It is in
good agreement with other data. Figure 6b shows the
UV–Vis absorbance spectra of silver nanoparticlecoated and uncoated fabrics. The intensity of absorbance was lower for uncoated fabric. A broad absorption peak was observed in the wavelength range of

J. Coat. Technol. Res.

400–550 nm for silver nanoparticles-coated fabrics,
proving the incorporation of silver nanoparticles in a
good manner. The absorbance intensity was higher for
ultrasonication-coated fabric than dip-coated fabric
confirming the presence of a higher amount of silver
nanoparticles.
Figure 7 shows the XRD patterns of the silver
nanoparticle-coated cotton fabric and pristine cotton
fabric. Figure 7a shows the diffraction peaks at 2h
values of 15.0, 16.7, 23.1, and 34.1 corresponding to
the (110), (110), (200), and (004) planes of pristine
cotton, respectively.39 Compared to the pristine fabric,
three additional peaks appeared at 2h values of 38.2,
45.1, and 65.0 (Figs. 7b and 7c) for silver nanoparticle-coated fabrics. It is attributed to the values of the
planes (111), (200), and (220) of silver nanoparticles,
respectively. This confirms that Ag NPs were deposited
on cotton fabric.

The surface morphology of the Ag NP-coated fabric
was investigated under scanning electron microscope
(SEM). Figure 8 shows the SEM micrograph images of
the uncoated and Ag NP-coated fabric. In the dip
coating, the fabric was immersed in colloidal silver
nanoparticles solution. The major challenge in the
nanodip coating is controlling the uniformity and
thickness of the coating. However, the uniform coating
was accomplished using green-synthesized colloidal
metallic silver nanoparticles. Figure 8a shows the
uncoated fabric with smooth surface and without any
contaminating particles on their surfaces. Figure 8b
shows the SEM images of Ag NP-coated fabric by dip
method. Figures 8c and 8d shows lower and higher
magnified SEM images of Ag NPs-coated fabric by
ultrasonication process. The images (Figs. 8b–8d) confirmed that a rough surface with a hierarchical structure was formed by deposition of Ag NPs on the

surface of the cotton fabric. From the SEM images, it is
inferred that the amount of deposited Ag NPs on fabric
is significantly higher for ultrasonicated fabric. The
silver nanoparticles coated by the dip coating method
have large particles of around 800 nm on the surface as
shown in Fig. 8b. It may due to the aggregation of
nanoparticles. But, in the case of the ultrasonication
coating process, the silver nanoparticles uniformly
dispersed on the surface of cotton fabric. Moreover,
the sizes of deposited particles are smaller (100–
200 nm). This might be due to the ultrasonic treatment
helping to disperse the nanoparticles during the coating process. Ultrasonication did not aid in the formation of new bonds between the silver and the functional
groups of the cotton fabric. Ultrasonication of a liquid
caused two primary effects, namely, cavitation and
heating.3 It was gleaned that the coating was due to the
physical adsorption of the nanoparticles on the substrate because of the ultrasonication. Besides, the
ultrasonication accelerated the adsorption of Ag NPs
on the cotton fabric’s surface and hence the Ag NPs

coating can be accomplished in a very short period by
the ultrasonication process rather than dip method.
The amount of silver content deposited on the cotton
fabric surface was quantified using an inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument. The silver content was determined as 1.53 and
1.67% for dip method and ultrasonication process,
respectively.
Figure 9 shows the tensile strength of the cotton
fabric before and after coating of Ag NPs. Warp
strength and elongation of fabrics are presented in
Table 1. The tensile strength of fabric increased after
the incorporation of silver nanoparticles. The uncoated
cotton fabric warp strength and elongation were
3.18 kg and 9.43%, respectively. The cotton fabric
which was coated by dip and ultrasonication process
showed warp strength and elongation were 3.57 kg and
9.61%, and 4.20 kg and 11.10%, respectively. The Ag
NP-coated fabric showed quite a high warp strength
and elongation compared to the uncoated fabric. The
incorporation of silver on cotton fabric was attributed

to the electrostatic interaction.38 Tang et al.38 achieved
the assembly of silver nanoparticles on fibers by linking
of poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride). This
could create an electrostatic interaction between silver
and the substrate. Sherazy et al.40 reported that the
formation of hydrogen bonding between coating material and substrate leads to higher tensile strength. In
this present study, the organic molecule which is
surrounded by silver nanoparticles may generate a
hydrogen bond with the functional group of cotton.
This might be the reason for an increase in tensile
strength. In the coating of silver nanoparticles, higher

amounts of Ag NPs were incorporated in the ultrasonication process than in the dip method. Due to the
presence of higher amounts of Ag NPs, higher tensile
strength was imparted. The tensile strength of ultrasonicated fabric was higher than that of fabric coated
by dip method. The observed changes in the mechanical properties of the fabric are in a range that is
acceptable for standard cotton fabrics. According to
these results, it is surmised that the coating of Ag NPs
on cotton fabric did not cause any significant damages.

conductivity (c) of pristine cotton fabric and silver
nanoparticles-coated cotton fabric. From Fig. 8a, it can
be noted that the value of dielectric constant was
higher for silver nanoparticles-coated cotton fabric
compared with pristine cotton fabric. However, the
dielectric constant decreased with an increase in
frequency for all the fabrics. It may due to the space
charge polarization and charge carrier which is responsible for different mechanisms of polarization. In
Fig. 8b, it is observed that the value of dielectric loss
is lower for silver nanoparticles-coated cotton fabric
compared with pristine cotton fabric and decreases
with increase in frequency for all the fabrics. Figure 8c
shows the AC electrical conductivity of pristine cotton
fabric and silver nanoparticles-coated cotton fabric at
room temperature. It can be noted that the AC
conductivity increased with an increase in frequency.
As frequency increased, hopping between charge
carriers increased which resulted in an increase in

AC conductivity of all samples. The AC conductivity
of dip coated was higher than pristine cotton fabric and
lower than the ultrasonication coated. Similarly, the
fabric coated by ultrasonication process had higher
conductivity than the pristine and dip-coated fabrics.
This might be due to the presence of higher amounts of
silver. Also, the conductivity was found to increases
about 2 9 108 S/cm and decreased resistivity for silver
nanoparticles-coated fabric. It was due to more charge
produced by silver nanoparticles.
The antibacterial properties of Ag NP-coated cotton
fabric were evaluated against Gram-positive S. aureus
bacteria strain using the disk diffusion technique.4,32
The uncoated fabric was used as a reference. Figure 11
shows the antimicrobial activity of pristine and silver
nanoparticles-coated fabric. The Ag NPs-incorporated
fabric showed an inhibition zone of considerable size
around the fabric (Fig. 11) for both dip and ultrasonicated specimens. The zone of inhibition represents the

chemical interaction, the nanoparticles were bound
uniformly on the fabric surface. The fabric coated with
Ag NPs exhibited good antibacterial activity against S.
aureus bacterial strain. The advantages of this process
are its ease to carry out and its efficiency. The coating
can be carried out using a solution immersion method.
The substances involved in this process are nontoxic,
low cost, and readily available. The fabrics thus coated
with Ag NPs can be used in several applications such as
wound dressing, bed lining, medicinal bandages, purification of medical and food equipment, and domestic
cleaning.

Ag NPs-incorporated fabric possesses antimicrobial
action due to the action of Ag NPs on the organism’s
membrane. The uncoated reference fabric did not
show any antibacterial activity. However, since the
diffusion of silver ions from the nanosilver-deposited
fabric to the saline was very slow, only a small part of
the total amount of silver particles could participate in
antibacterial activity. The zone of inhibition was
broader for ultrasonicated fabric than the dip-coated
fabric. It may due to the presence of higher amounts of
Ag NPs in ultrasonicated fabric sample than the dipcoated fabric. The higher diameter of inhibition zone
around the sample shows that the Ag NPs-coated
fabric has a better antibacterial effect against S. aureus.
By increasing the thickness of the coating, it is possible
to enhance the antimicrobial activity.

Conclusion
Silver nanoparticles were successfully synthesized
using P. pterocarpum flower extract. The synthesized
Ag NPs were coated on cotton fabric so as to enhance
the multifunctional properties of the fabric. The
deposition of Ag NPs on cotton fabric was accomplished through a dip method and ultrasonication
process. The ultrasonic treatment helped to disperse
the nanoparticles and allow for homogeneous deposition. Nanoparticles were firmly adsorbed on the
surface of the fabric. They were stable and could not

Abstract: Conductive filler loading in the polymer matrix is a common practice to transform insulative polymers to
conducting composites. In case of textiles, the highly promising approach has been coined by virtue of fabricating with
conductive adhesive homogeneous coating. The present fabrication approach has been developed by two-stage wet mixing
technique including synthesis of silver nanoparticles decorated graphene sheets (rGO/Ag), followed by the preparation of
conducting coating by non-ionic polymer adhesive. The novelty lies in the choice of conductive material and coating strategy
to make lightweight and flexible smart electronic fabric. In order to protect the radiation pollution from the immense use of
electronic devices and gadgets, the coated textiles can be an excellent replacement of other commercially available polymer
coatings. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of the prepared coated textile was 27.36 dB in the X
band (8.2-12.4 GHz). Besides this it is worth mentioning that our developed coated fabric was enough conductive to light up
a series of 57 LEDs with high intensity. Last but not the least this work also reconnoitres bactericidal feature against E. coli.
Keywords: Cotton fabric, Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE), Antibacterial activity

huge growth of bacterial cell creates a major problem to the
human health including diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and
fever for specially hospital and pharmaceutical workers [9,
10]. Those bacterial cells showed long exposure time in
fabrics, lab coats etc. The above problem can be solved by
making antibacterial fabrics or textiles with the help of
polymeric coating to protect against those pathogens [11].
Since, the cotton textiles are made from natural fibres, it has
a high chance of microbial attack resulting delayed
degradation in its period of application. Thus the prepared
coated materials were chosen in such a way where it can
serve dually, i.e., electrical conductivity and antibacterial
activity.
Nanoscale based carbonaceous materials e.g., carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), reduced
graphene oxides (rGO), metallic material such as silver
nanoparticles and other conductive polymers with high
aspect ratio have been attempted by many researchers for
making conductive as well as microwave absorbing
materials [12-25]. Recently, graphene has been attracted by
several research groups due to its high surface area,
conductivity, stability towards the thermal and chemical
environment and amazing flexibility [26]. Several research
teams developed graphene based conducting products after
optimizing the graphene functional group for flexible
electronics. Barium ferrite ornamented reduced graphene
oxide was used to achieve around 32 dB EMI SE over the
Ku band frequency range under the critical thickness of
3 mm [27]. Liu et al. reported three dimensional porous

Introduction
In the modern age, the tremendous use of scientific and
engineering devices has ensured in the rising exposure of
electromagnetic radiation waves. Long term exposure towards
the electromagnetic waves is a critical issue to handle and
sometimes undesirable due to environmental and health
related problems [1-5]. Those unwanted electromagnetic
(EM) waves often interfere with other electronic signals
which cause antennae effects, hardware malfunctioning or
inaccurate signal transmission. This kind of interference
generates high level of dissipated energy named as
electromagnetic interference or shortly EMI. Consequently,
it has the utmost necessity to absorb and shield those
electromagnetic signals to maintain the proper signal
transmission mostly in the area of aerospace, telecommunication and military bases [6,7]. To provide a healthy
and safe environment from the acute radiation pollution,
scientists are taking immense interest in developing innovative
EM shield materials. Therefore, the textile-based materials
can be a promising solution due to enough flexibility and
resistance towards all deformation without degradation.
Besides this, dielectric permittivity, impedance matching,
thickness etc. are mostly related with microwave attenuation.
Owing to the intrinsic conductivity and low cost commercially
viable material, carbonaceous fillers are the best choice to
achieve moderate shielding performance [8]. Further, the

graphene foam with the help of thermally reduced graphene
oxide/PVA, which enhances the EMI SE value up to 43.5 dB
at a low filler content with the thickness of 3.5 mm [28].
Metal oxide or metal nanoparticles incorporated graphenebased hybrid composites also enhanced the capacitive
performance. This lead to ameliorate the shielding efficiency
synergistically, which was practiced by many researchers
[29-32]. Silver nanoparticles and graphene based fillers were
also used to improve the absorbing capability of the incident
EM waves along with the enhancement in mechanical
characteristics [33-36]. Though conductive polymer composites provide outstanding shielding capability compared
with metal-based composites, but they are lacking from
processing difficulties, manufacturing cost etc. Currently,
silver nanoparticles have been reported in many literatures to
suppress the bacterial growth [37]. It is believed that, silver
nanoparticles having high affinity towards the DNA of the
bacterial cell and release silver ions (Ag+) which react with
the phosphorous moieties of DNA molecules. Due to this
reason enzymatic function has been inhibited, resulting
bacterial cell to death [38].
Herein, an energy intensive green coating process has
been adopted in order to fabricate thin coated wearable
fabrics. We adopt a facile and unique dip-coating technique
to coat the cotton fabric by chemically reduced AgNPs
decorated graphene sheets. The uniqueness of the present
work lies in their choice of such metal decorated nanoparticles
along with the water based coating mixture to develop
highly effective EMI shielding fabrics. Silver nanoparticles
decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO/Ag) have been
prepared via in situ reduction of AgNO3 and GO using
hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, we performed the dipcoating technique in the thinnest possible manner where
PVP macromolecular chains have been exploited as
cementing agent between cotton fabric and nanoparticles.
Several characterization has been carried out to study the
morphological (both 2D and 3D) features, electrical
conductivity, EMI shielding effectiveness (including thermal
air-ageing treatment) by controlling the dip-coating cycles
(or counts). Additionally, this novel silver anchored
nanocomposites can effectively act as antibacterial agent
resulting in extra merit to this conductive fabric development
strategy as a bactericidal fabric.

Experimental
Raw Materials
Desized, scoured and bleached 100 % cotton fabric (Cf)
was used as the substrate. Graphite fine powder (particle size
< 70 mesh), silver nitrate (AgNO3), hydrazine hydrate and
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, M.W. 40,000) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (USA). The crystalline form potassium
permanganate (KMnO4) (>99 % purity), sulphuric acid
(H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 30 % solution, were

procured from Merck, Germany. The water (DI) used in all
the experiments was purified using a Milli-Q system with
the resistivity of higher than 18.1 MΩcm-1.
Synthesis of Silver Decorated Graphene Nanocomposite
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from graphite
flakes according to the modified Hummer’s method [39].
Briefly 2.5 g of as purchased graphite powder was taken in a
beaker containing 100 ml of H2SO4 (98 %) in an ice bath and
sonicated for 30 min with regular stirring for 1 h. KMnO4
(12.5 g) was mixed slowly on the above solution. During
mixing the temperature was maintained at 10 oC using ice
medium. Afterwards, the whole mixture was assigned to
react at room temperature for 20 h with normal stirring. To
cease the reaction, temperature was again dropped to 10 oC,
with the use of ice medium, and 125 ml of DI water was
added slowly maintaining the temperature. Later, 3 ml of
H2O2 (30 %) was added in the resultant mixture to destroy
the excess permanganate and the whole mixture was stirred
for another 2 h. Then, this solution was kept for 1 h followed
by rinsing the supernatant, with 10 % HCl, acetone, slight
amount of ethanol and then DI water. At that moment,
250 ml of water was added for next 24 h to settle the GO
layer. When permanganate destroyed, the mixture was
turned into yellow colored solution. Then the mixture was
centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was
discarded followed by the washing treatment with DI water
until the pH became in the range of 6 to 7. The residual mass
was initially air dried for 24 h and then vacuum dried at
70 oC for 10 h.
In order to prepare silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) decorated
graphene sheets, the as-prepared GO was sonicated in
aqueous medium for 45 min. After that, AgNO3 solution
(0.5 M) was added slowly in drop-wise manner. Later, the
whole mixture was stirred for ~15 min. To reduce the
dispersion, hydrazine hydrate was added drop wise with
continuous magnetic stirring. After the desired homogenization,
the mixture was transferred to the Teflon lined stainless steel
autoclave. The autoclave was fastened tightly with steel
gasket and kept in a muffle at 180 oC for 8 h. After the tenure
completion, the total mass was collected into a centrifuge
tube and washed several time with water. Then the residue
mass was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 oC for overnight.
Finally we get greyish dried mass of silver nanoparticles
decorated reduced graphene oxide which was denoted by
rGO/Ag.
Preparation of rGO/Ag Decorated Cotton Fabric
The AgNPs decorated rGO coated cotton fabric was
fabricated by the simple dip-coating method as schematically
shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 0.5 wt% rGO/Ag was dispersed
into the DI water. After that, calculated quantity of PVP
(0.2 wt%) was added followed by probe sonication for
30 min. The fabric was dipped into the prepared suspension

for 7-10 sec and dried into the oven at 70 oC. The dipping
and drying process was repeated for 30 times (cycles or
counts) to get the fine-coating of rGO/Ag on the surface
cotton fabric. The modified cotton fabrics were highlighted
as rACf-X, where r represents reduced graphene oxide, A
stands for the Ag nanoparticles, Cf denotes cotton fabric and
X represents the number of dip-coating cycles.
Material Characterization
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy of the
nanocomposite material was collected by Perkin Elmer
UV-vis spectrophotometer lambda 35. The wavelength
range was 200-700 nm. Raman spectroscopy of the coated
fabrics was carried out by Trivista 555 spectrograph
(Princeton Instruments) and 647 nm excitation from Kr+
laser are utilized for this test (Coherent, Sabre Innova SBRCDBWK). The power used for each sample was around 1012 mW. The acquisition time was recorded at 120 s for each
spectrum in the range of 900-2000 cm-1. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) study was performed by X-PERTPRO PANalytical
diffractometer using CuKα source at 1 o min-1 scanning rate
using generator voltage and current at 40 kV and 30 mA
respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) of the coated fabric was analyzed by Perkin-Elmer
spectrometer Spectrum-2), Singapore using ATR mode at
the frequency range of 4000-400 cm-1. Optical microscopy
of the coated fabrics was conducted using leica Qwin V3.5.1
optical microscope. Surface topology of the coated fabrics
was characterized by field emission-scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM) after a very thin coated layer with Au
on the samples via sputtering with 5 kV acceleration voltages
for 2 min. The distribution of the nanocomposite within the
fabric was analyzed by high resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100 with 200 kV acceleration

voltage, Tokyo, Japan). The samples (thickness of ~300 nm)
were prepared by ultra-microtome using Leica Ultra cut
UCT (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). The surface
dimensional behavior of the coated fabrics was collected by
atomic force microscope (Agilent Technology, 5500 AFM)
in a tapping mode with applied force constant of 48 N/m and
tip material was Si3N4, tip curvature length and cantilever
length were <10 nm and <100 μm respectively. The
tomography imaging of coated fabrics was monitored using
micro-CT scan measurement (GE, Pheonix v/tome/xs) by
applying -120 kV, -90 µA, 10.8w X-ray. The scan was
performed for 1 hour. After reconstruction of the 2D images,
3D image of the coated fabric was generated using analytical
software VG Studio Max 2.2 (Volume Graphics, Germany).
The thickness of the coated fabrics was measured by the
digital thickness meter by taking the average value of 10
thickness measurements. The rGO/Ag content was determined
by measuring the weight of the coated fabric samples with
2×2 cm2 considering the average value of 10 measurements.
The DC resistivity of the coated fabrics was calculated by
Agilent 4339B and Agilent 34401A 6 1/2 digit multimeters
at room temperature through circular Cu (copper) electrode
(area=1.327 cm2). The undersigned equation was used for
measuring DC conductivity: σ=t/(R.A), where σ is the
conductivity, A is the area of the specimen, t is the thickness
of the sample in cm and, R is the measured resistance in
ohm. The error percentage was in between ±3 %. The
electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of the
coated fabrics was calculated using an ENA Network Analyzer
(model E5071C, MY46109484), Agilent Technologies,
Inc., Santa Clara, California, United States in the X-band
frequency range (8.2-12.4 GHz) by the two-port waveguide
test method. The error percentage was in between ±5 %. The
antibacterial tests of the GO coated fabric and rGO/Ag
decorated fabric were performed by inhibition zone
measurement. Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common gram
negative bacterium was used as model for antibacterial
measurement.

Results and Discussion
UV-vis Spectra Analysis of the Nanocomposites
The ultraviolet visible spectra of GO and rGO/Ag
nanocomposites was shown in Figure 1(a-b). The aqueous
dispersion of GO shows standard absorption peak at 228 nm
due to the π-π* transition of aromatic C=C bond [37]. As
depicted in Figure 1(b), GO peak in rGO/Ag nanocomposites
was shifted to 276 nm. This is known as red shift. This shift
ascribed to the structural regeneration array among the sp2
hybridized conjugated carbon atoms. At around 404 nm, one
new peak was observed due to the formation of AgNPs. The
above peak indicates surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of
Ag nanoparticles [40]. Those peaks support the formation of
AgNPs decorated rGO nanocomposite.

XRD and Raman Spectroscopy of the Coated Fabrics
XRD plots of the cotton fabric coated with GO and rGO/
Ag nanoparticles were shown in Figure 1(c-d). There is one
sharp peak at 10.2 o which belongs to the (002) crystal plane
(Figure 1(c)) [41]. But for rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric,
the dominating peak of GO almost diminished. Moreover,
one new peak around 23.1 o was pointed out due to the
reduction of GO phase (Figure 1(d)) [42]. The fundamental
peaks of Ag were pointed out at the 2θ of 37.8 o, 44.0 o,
64.3 o, 77.1 o and 81.5 o which relate with the (111), (200),
(220), (311) and (222) crystal planes (Joint Committee on
Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS File No. 04-0783).
Raman spectra of the cotton fabric coated with GO and rGO/
Ag nanoparticles was shown in Figure 2(a). There are two

very primary peaks: first one is the G type, which relates
with the 1st order phonon scattering of E2g corresponding to
the aromatic carbons (sp2) of graphene sheets. The other one
is the D type, which relates with the A1g symmetry
corresponding to the breathing mode vibration of j-point
phonon [43]. Two peaks at 1350 cm-1 and 1596 cm-1 were
observed for the GO coated fabric, corresponding to the D
and G bands. Both the peaks were shifted to the lower
wavelength of around 1348 cm-1 and 1592 cm-1 for rACf-30,
due to the reduction of GO during in-situ treatment. The
ID/IG ratio was determined by the structural attributes of the
composites. If the ID/IG value is high, the structural attributes
are also followed the same trend. For GO coated fabric, the
value is around ~1.02 which relates with the oxygenated

surface functional groups. After rGO/Ag coating treatment,
the ID/IG ratio shifted to ~0.91 which supports the reduction
of GO phase. The Raman spectra of pristine Ag coated
cotton fabric was shown in Figure 2(b). The above results
were helped to better understand the DC conductivity and
EMI shielding performance of the coated fabric discussed
later.
Morphological Characteristic of the rGO/Ag Decorated
Cotton Fabric
The morphological characteristic of the rGO/Ag decorated
cotton fabric was carried out by five different techniques
such as: Optical microscopy, FESEM, HRTEM, AFM and
micro-CT scanning. In Figure 3, the woven pattern of the
untreated cotton fabric was clearly distinguished by FESEM
analysis. After coating treatment the surface of the fabric
become rough. As the nanocomposite loading increased, the
pores or voids within the fabric were gradually filled with
rGO decorated by AgNPs. The color of the fabric was
changed after each dip-coating treatment. Morphological
overview of the rGO/Ag nanoparticles coated cotton fabric
was shown in Figure 4(a-h). On the above images, we can
clearly visualize that AgNPs were decorated over the rGO
nanosheets. The decoration of the AgNPs over the rGO
nanosheets was uniform and layered due to the strong
electrostatic force. The interfacial adhesion between PVP
molecules helps to attach the coating on the surface of the
fabric. Simultaneously, the coatings were very strong due to
the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic adsorption between
the coating layer and the fibers of the fabric material. FTIR
plot showed the broadening effect at 3200-3400 cm-1 which
indicate intermolecular H-bonding between the fabric and
coating materials (Figure 5). SAED (selected area electron
diffraction) pattern (Figure 4(f) inset) showed 4 prominent
concentric circles corresponding to the characteristic lattice
planes of fcc Ag: (111), (200), (220) and (311). Those
prominent SAED pattern disclosed the decoration of quasispherical AgNPs on the graphene surface with highly
crystalline even at nanoscale domain. From the AFM study,

Figure 5. FTIR spectrum of rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric.

we can easily checked out the regular arrangement of
AgNPs over the rGO nanosheets after 30 dip-coating
treatment with the thickness of 0.29 mm. Unique micro-CT
imaging was carried out to find out the distribution of voids
or pores during coating treatment into three dimensional
space. As shown in Figure 6(a-d), the spherical particles
were disclosed uncoated region and the rest one indicating
the coated region. As per the histogram, only 5.25 % voids
were remained after coating treatment (rACf-30) and the
volume of the voids were recorded by the color scale. The
top side (Figure 6(a)), right side (Figure 6(b)), front side
(Figure 6(c)) and 3D view (Figure 6(d)) also revealed the
uniform coating of rGO/Ag into the cotton fabric. Note that,
conductive rGO based AgNPs act as an effective conducting
agent to create a conductive pathway within the fabric for
electron transport which can improve electrical property and
EM performances.
Electrical Property (DC Conductivity)
The electrical measurement of the uncoated and coated
fabrics under different dip-coating cycles was shown in
Figure 6(e). Untreated cotton was insulating in nature and
the electrical conductivity of ~10-13 S cm-1 was recorded for
the cotton fabric. It is noted that, DC conductivity of the

coated fabrics was gradually increased with increasing the
dip-coating cycles at ambient temperature. DC conductivity
is linearly related with the thickness of the coating. Table 1
showed the apparent thickness of the coated fabric after
coating treatment. The rGO/Ag concentration (1.7-13.2 wt %)
along with the rGO/Ag coating thickness (0.03-0.14 mm) on
the cotton fabric increased by the dip-coating treatment. The
continuous conducting network formed all over the fabric
provides high electrical conductivity. Only rGO or AgNPs
coated cotton fabric unveiled poor electrical conductivity
because bare AgNPs or rGO nanosheets could not build up a

continuous conducting network [44]. AgNPs provides ndoping effect which improve the connection between
consecutive rGO sheets. The presence of rGO nanosheet
provides more active site for Ag deposition. The minimal
energy to transfer of electrons form graphene basal plane/
surface could be facilitated after incorporation of AgNPs
upon rGO sheets. This sometimes called as the ‘percolation’
doping effect which is solely improvised after deposition of
AgNPs over rGO nanosheets. This phenomenon helped in
lowering of electronic resistance than pristine rGO sheets
and enhanced the fast charge transportation, resulting

1168

Fibers and Polymers 2019, Vol.20, No.6

improvement in electronic effect. The DC conductivity
values for only rGO loaded fabrics were 1.2×10-12 S cm-1
and 0.033 S cm-1 for 1 dipping (thickness of 0.18 mm) and
30 dipping (thickness of 0.29 mm) cycles respectively. The
DC conductivity of cotton fabric coated with rGO/Ag
increases from 6.2×10-6 S cm-1 for rACf-1 to 1.701 S cm-1
for rACf-30. DC conductivity of the coated fabrics increased
with increasing the dip-coating cycles due to the uniform
coating of AgNPs on the cotton fabric which increase the
degree of electron conduction between the deposited
AgNPs. During higher dip-coating cycle, the synergistic
effect of rGO/Ag was also involved for improvement in
electrical conductivity. To measure the electrical conductivity
for external application, one practical test is carried out. A
hand-made electrical circuit was made by our research team
which contained 57 LED lights and external voltage was
coming from the domestic power source. The uncoated
fabric was failed to make a conductive channel to lighten up
the LEDs. Moreover, when we connected the coated fabric,

Sabyasachi Ghosh et al.

the LEDs were lightened up (Figure 6(f)). The brightness of
the LED lights increased with increasing the dip-coating
cycles [45]. The presence of rGO nanosheets at the interface
improved the interfacial resistance of the cotton fabric
(plausible mechanism showed in Figure 6(g)). This observation
also relates with the excellent electrical network formation
on the fabric after coating treatment.
EMI SE
The uncontrolled growth of electronic devices throughout
the whole world has been suffering from excessive use of
electromagnetic waves. Thus it is quite essential to evaluate
the extent of electromagnetic radiation by means of
calculating the EMI SE of the coated fabrics. In this present
study, we have analysed the EMI shielding phenomena of
the rGO/Ag nanoparticles decorated cotton fabric at X band
(8.2-12.4 GHz) frequency range. Usually, EMI shielding
performance of the material is expressed in decibel (dB).
The total EMI SE of the rACf composite is calculated after

taking the logarithmic ratio of incident power (Pin) to the
transmitted power (Pout) of the radiation.

EMI SE (dB) = 10log10 ⎛ ------⎝ Pout⎠

(1)

where, Pin and Pout are the incident and transmitted power
respectively. The EMI attenuation can be classified into
three major categories such as reflection, absorption, and
multiple reflections [46].
EMI SE = SER + SEA + SEM

(2)

where EMI SE denotes the shielding effectiveness, and SER,
SEA, and SEM represent the shielding effectiveness due to
reflection, absorption and multiple reflections respectively.
For practical application, SEM is neglected for the values
when SEA is higher than 10 dB.
EMI SE (dB) = SEA (dB) + SER (dB)

(3)

The reflection of EM wave mainly depends on the
impedance imbalance between air and the absorber. The
absorption is due to the energy dissipation of incident EM
wave as heat energy through the shielded material and
multiple reflections occurred due to internal reflection and
scattering effect within the matrix [47-49]. Figure 7(a, b)
shows the EMI shielding performances of the rGO/Ag
nanoparticles decorated cotton fabric with different dipcoating cycles in the X-band frequency range (8.2-12.4 GHz).
In general, pure cotton fabric is transparent to the
electromagnetic waves. It is noted that, the decoration of
rGO/Ag nanoparticles were prominent with increasing the
dip-coating cycle. rGO embedded AgNPs enhanced the
electrical conductivity or electrical polarization. The
increment in shielding behavior may be related with the
developed conducting channel along with the flow of free
electron or holes in the matrix phase [45,47]. After
increasing the dip-coating cycles the deposition of AgNPs
were distinguishable which was clearly shown in the optical
images (Figure 4(a, b)). The low cycle dip coated fabric (3
counts with thickness of 0.19 mm) displayed SE value of
6.32 dB whether the fabric coated with 20 counts (with
thickness of 0.26 mm) showed SE value of 22.94 dB which
mainly blocked >90 % EM waves in the measured
frequency range. The average shielding efficiency of cotton
fabric (dip-coated counts 30 with thickness of 0.29 mm) was
around 27.36 dB (blocked ~99 % of EM waves) in the Xband region, which is higher than 20 dB mostly required for
the commercial application. Based on the results we can
predict that, rGO/Ag nanoparticles induced interfacial
polarization and dipole relaxation due to the charge
accumulation at the interfaces of cotton fabric and the
formation of large dipoles were enhanced which further
reinforced the EM performances. To understand the
fundamental reason towards the EM shielding efficiency of
the coated fabrics, the measurement of the sum of absorption

1169

effectiveness (SEA), reflection effectiveness (SER) and total
shielding effectiveness (SET) as the function of dip-coating
cycles were shown in Figure 4(b). It is noted that SEA, SER
and EMI SE were increased with increasing dip-coating
cycles due to the deposition of more conducting fillers on the
cotton fabric which induced the higher shielding efficiency.
Moreover, SEA value of the fabric during coating treatment
(1-30 dip-coating cycles) increases from 3.01 to 19.86 dB.
The SER value followed the same trend varied from 0.64 to
7.50 dB during coating treatment. From the above values, it
is clearly noted that absorption-dominated shielding
phenomena for the coated fabrics as the SER values are far
less than SEA. Due to this reason, high amount of EM waves
were absorbed on the fabrics which may relate with the
formation of conducting path during dip-coating treatment.
AgNPs decorated rGO nanosheets acted as an intertransporting charge carriers for tunnelling more electrons
which induce EM shielding efficiency.
Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Performance
after Thermal Air Ageing
Thermal air-ageing is one of the most important study to
investigate the serviceability of the material towards the
outdoor application. The SEA, SER and SET values of the
coated fabrics depicted marginal change after thermal airageing study (continuous heating at 120 oC for 1 hour) which
were shown in Figure 7(c, d). The EMI SE of the coated
fabrics increases from 18.64 to 26.14 dB during coating
treatment (dip-coated counts varied from 20-30 with the
thickness range of 0.26-0.29 mm). From the above
experiment we can say that, the service life of the fabrics is
extremely good (under hot air-environment as well as room
temperature) for commercialization purpose as a smart etextile material.
Antibacterial Study of GO and rGO/Ag Decorated Cotton
Fabric
Antibacterial nature of the prepared coated fabrics was
described by measuring the zone of inhibition against E.
coli. In Figure 8(a) we can visualize the digital image of
rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric under the agar plate, where
the inhibition zone was clearly distinguished. Two different
samples were tested to measure the zone of inhibition. For
only GO coated fabric, the inhibition zone was ~0.1 cm. But,
for the rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric, the zone of
inhibition was 1.0 cm (dip-coated counts 30 with the
thickness of 0.29 mm). From the above values proved that
the rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric suppress the bacterial
growth of E. coli. The bacterium was adhered with the rGO
surface of the coated fabric due to the large surface area of
rGO nanosheets. The deposited AgNPs interacted with the
bacterial cell-wall. It is noted that, AgNPs have high
tendency to interact with the sulfur and phosphorus
containing compound (e.g. DNA of the bacterial cell) [37,

38]. So that, they can attach with the surface of the bacterial
cell wall and release Ag+ ions which enhance the production
of reactive oxygen species i.e. ROS. ROS travel within the
bacterial cell and block the respiratory system resulting in
bacterial death. The major role of rGO nanosheets is that,
they stabilize the deposited AgNPs within the fabric. Hence,
the approach towards the bacterial cell-wall is more induced

system of the bacteria. The rACf-30 cotton fabric exhibits an
inhibition zone of 1.0 cm against E. coli. The findings of the
present study are committed for the development of smart etextile that can be used in different advanced areas like
portable and bendable electronics, telecommunication and
medicinal field.

Herein, we report a simple and facile route to fabricate
rGO/Ag decorated cotton fabric having high electrical
conductivity and superior electromagnetic shielding efficiency.
The rGO/Ag nanocomposite as a coating material having
excellent capability to turn the fabric electrically conductive.
The rGO/Ag nanocomposite was prepared by single stage
hydrothermal method. PVP acts as a binder material which
enhanced the adhesion capability of the conducting nanoparticles towards the cotton substrate. The rGO nanosheets
stabilize the deposited AgNPs which generate a continuous
connecting bridge to tunnel more electrons after dip-coating
treatment of cotton fabric. As per the dip-coating treatment,
DC conductivity of around 1.701 S cm-1 and EMI SE of
27.3 dB were achieved by only 30 dip-coating cycles and
thickness of the fabric was around 0.29 mm. Unique microCT imaging relates with the microstructural distribution of
rGO stabilized AgNPs in 3D space. The prepared fabrics
were very lightweight, highly flexible and maintain their EM
performances under thermal air-ageing treatment. Beside
this, the modified fabric showed antibacterial effect via
destroying the cell-membrane and blocking the respiratory

Abstract: Ag deposited ZnO (Ag/ZnO) nano materials with different Ag molar content were prepared via chemical
precipitation method. The morphology of nano ZnO was rod like, while the size was 170 nm in length and 30 nm in diameter.
Silver nanoparticles were found to be spherical with the diameter about 15 nm. When it deposited on the surface of the nano
ZnO, the size of the nano ZnO was almost unchanged when the doping amount is 2.5 %. All the samples were treated on
cotton fabric, and the laden fabric had excellent performance on hydrophobicity, including UV resistance, antibacterial
activity and anti-mildew. The contact angle of fabric loaded with 3 % Ag/ZnO was 139 compare to nano ZnO, which was
103 . The fabric loaded with Ag/ZnO had superior performance of UV resistance. With the increase of depositing amount,
the antibacterial rates were promoted; the antibacterial rates against S. aureus, E. coil, and C. albicans of fabric with 3 % Ag/
ZnO were promoted to 91 %, 96 % and 98 %. Moreover, Ag/ZnO gave cotton fabrics good anti-mildew performance,
especially A. flavus, and its anti-mildew effect could reach 0 grade.

properties, such as antibacterial, anti UV, super hydrophobic,
so ZnO has become one of the nano materials, having great
development of multifunctional textiles [11]. Tran Thi et al.
[12] used a new self-cleaning cotton fabric coated with ZnO
was obtained via a facile and effective microwave method. It
is proved that the photocatalytic and wettability performances
of ZnO could be efficiently transferred to cotton fabric,
leading to a preeminent UV-blocking and self-cleaning
cotton fabric. Attia et al. [13] studied ZnO nanowires have
been grown on cotton fabric, and these results suggest that
ZnO nanowires could form ideal multifunctional coatings
for textiles to impart self-cleaning, super hydrophobicity and
ultraviolet blocking properties. Chakrabarti et al. [14]
prepared multifunctional cotton fabric by pad-dry-coating
with no chemically synthesized ZnO nanoparticles. As a
result of coating, the fabric shows enhanced mechanical
strength, water and stain repellence, antimicrobial properties,
UV-blocking capacity and self-cleaning characteristics
compared to the uncoated fabric.
The function of textiles is more and more abundant, but
the antibacterial property of textiles is the most basic and
most important feature of its functional development [15].
This is because the porous form of textiles is a good carrier
for the growth of a variety of microbes and bacteria. They
not only pollute textiles, but also affect the quality of
textiles, make the textiles decolorized or moldy. And these
bacteria can also effect the health of the body through the
transmission from the fabric [16,17]. In the absence of light
source, nanoscale ZnO has weak antibacterial properties
[18], and in direct application, its anti-mildew effect is not
ideal [19], and the combination of the material with the

Introduction
Since a single functional product has not been able to meet
the market demand, functional textiles have gradually
become one of the main trend in today's textile development.
The research and development of functional textiles has
expanded to a lot of fields and has been applying widely [1].
Given textile multifunction is a hot research topic. If fiber
is processed through one time, a variety of new functions
can be introduced, which not only improves the added value
of textiles, but also reduces the finishing processes. It is
good for energy saving and environmental protection. The
development of textile finishing agents with multiple
functions [2-4] has significant economic and social benefits.
In the development of functional textiles, the most widely
used in China is the combination of nanomaterials and
textile materials. As the nanometer powder material changes,
the function of the textile changes too. Such as far-infrared
textiles [5], anti-UV textiles [6], antibacterial fabrics [7],
antistatic fabric [8], flame-retardant fabric [9] etc. The
auxiliaries of treatment usually include organic compounds
and inorganic nanomaterials. Compared with organic
compounds, the inorganic nanomaterials have the advantages
of nontoxicity and are chemically stable under high
temperature and sunlight [10].
Nano Zinc Oxide (ZnO) has the advantages of low cost,
small size effect, surface effect, quantum effect and its
application in fabric finishing shows many special excellent

cotton is not high [20].
In order to improve its drawbacks, some other antibacterial
materials [21-23] have been introduced by scholars, which
not only can greatly improve the water resistance of cotton
fabrics, but also improve their antibacterial properties, and
also give other functional properties of cotton fabrics. The
finished cotton fabric becomes a multi-functional and high
value-added fabric, which is more satisfied with the pursuit
of high grade, comfortable and with special features [24].
Zhang et al. [25] describes a new strategy of fabricating
multifunctional textile through in-situ synthesis of Ag
nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles. The treated cotton
fabrics have excellent UV protective property and antibacterial
activity simultaneously. Chen et al. [26] composes polymer
quaternary ammonium salt/nano-ZnO composite antibacterial
agent via in-situ method. Compared with the control cotton
sample, the cotton treated with the P(DMDAAC-AGEMAA)/nano-ZnO composite after 10 times of standard
washing not only shows the antibacterial properties against
Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus) is still above 80 %, but also has no effect on the
breaking strength. El-Naggar et al. [27] describes a simple
chemical synthetic route, designed to prepare zinc oxide
nanoparticles ZnO-NPs. And then surface modification of
ZnO-NPs with SiO2 nanoparticles is achieved as per to solgel process. The work was extended to render cotton fabrics
multifunctional properties such as antibacterial and UV
protection with high durability even after 20 washing cycles
using pad dry cure method.
Nano silver is not only an efficient antibacterial material,
but also can endure an excellent anti UV property for cotton
fabric. On the one hand through the synergistic effect of
nano ZnO and Ag, the cotton fabric has broad-spectrum
antibacterial and mildew resistance, and super hydrophobic
and anti-UV properties. On the other hand, nanoparticles
with hydroxyl effect of cotton fiber surface, improve the
nanoparticles and cotton fibers with fastness.
In this work, Ag deposited ZnO nano powder had been
prepared through simple chemical precipitation method. The
different molar percentages of Ag deposited ZnO was
finished on the cotton fabric. The synthesized products were
characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy (UV), X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The
morphology of the cotton fabrics had been observed by
SEM. The antibacterial property, anti-mildew property, UV
resistance performance, hydrophobic property of fabric had
been investigated too.

Dangge Gao et al.

AR, Tianjin Hongyan Reagent Plant, China), Ethanol (AR,
Tianjin Hongyan ReagentPlant, China)were all used without
further purification. The ATCC25923), and the fungi Candida
albicans (C. albicans, ATCC10231) were provided by Xi’an
Microorganism Research Institution and incubated at 37 oC
on a nutrient agar plate for 24 h before use. All the water
used in process was distilled water.
Preparation of Ag/ZnO Nanorods
The hydrate of 7.32 g Zinc acetate dehydrated and silver
nitrate dissolved into distilled water (Ag/Zn ratios: 0 %, 1 %,
1.5 %, 2 %, 2.5 %, 3 %). 9.33 g sodium hydroxide was
dissolved into distilled water to form sodium solution. In the
condition of 65 oC, the Zn(AC)2 solution and sodium
solution were mixed and stirred for 3 h. Then the silver
nitrate hexahydrate solution was added and kept stirring for
2 h. The solution then was kept at 90 oC for 3 h. The
prepared sample was washed with distilled water and then
with ethanol two times through centrifugation respectively.
Finally, the brown colored powder was obtained after
drying. The pure ZnO and AgO were also prepared using
this method.
Characterization of Ag/ZnO Nanorods
The crystal structure of Ag/ZnO nano powders was
determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The Ag deposited
ZnO and undeposited ZnO powder were subjected to X-ray
diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advance CuKα1=
1.5405 Å at room temperature. SEM technique was used to
observe the particle sizes, and rough morphology of the
particles. The surface morphology of the samples was
studied using a scanning electron microscope. The UV-vis
absorption of Ag/ZnO was determined by 61 CRT
Spectrophotometer (Shanghai Instrument Factory, China)
with the wavelength ranges from 190 to 850 nm using 1 cm
quartz cuvettes at room temperature.
Applied to Cotton Fabric
Cotton knitted fabrics (35 cm×35 cm) were treated with
deposited ZnO and undeposited ZnO separately. The procedure
was simple and shown in Figure 1. The nanomaterials was
dispersed in distilled water, and the samples were immersed
in the 30 g/l Ag/ZnO solution or ZnO solution for padded
and dried at 95 oC for 5 min in a preheated oven to remove
the moisture, and then baked at 125 oC for 10 min. The
solution containing no ZnO and Ag/ZnO materials was
prepared as a control group.

room temperature. The contact angles were determined by
averaging values of 5-6 different points on each sample
surface.
UV Resistance Property
The UV-vis resistance property of the cotton fabric was
measured by the transmittance. The UV-vis transmittance
spectrum of the cotton fabric was carried out by 61 CRT
Spectrophotometer (Shanghai Instrument Factory, China)
with the wave length ranges from 200 to 400 nm at room
temperature.
Antibacterial Property
The antibacterial activity of the treated fabric was tested
against the bacteria S. aureus, E. coli and the fungi C.
albicans according to the FZ/T 73023-2006 standard method.
The percent reductions of bacteria as the antibacterial rate
were calculated according to the following equation:

where, R is the antibacterial rate (%), A is the number of
bacteria recovered from the inoculated treated test specimen
swatches in the jar incubated over the desired contact period,
B is the number of bacteria recovered from the inoculated
treated test specimen swatches in the jar immediately after
inoculation (at 0 contact time).
Antifungal Property
The antifungal activity of the treated fabric was tested
against the A. flavus according to the FZ/T 60030-2009

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Ag/ZnO Nanorods
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The crystal structure of nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO had been
studied by XRD. As shown in Figure 2, all the peaks in the
pattern was indexed to the wurtzite phase of ZnO with a
hexagonal structure [28,29]. As shown in the figure, the
nano ZnO had a sharp peak at 2 theta about 32 o, 34 o, 36 o,
48 o, 58 o, 62 o, 66 o, 68 o and 69 o, and these peaks belonged

to the X-diffraction peak of wurtzite ZnO. Compare to XRD
spectra of ZnO nanoparticles, the peak position of Ag/ZnO
had no obvious deviations, the height and width of the peaks
on each crystal surface were almost unchanged, it was
shown that the presence of Ag did not change the lattice
peak of nano ZnO, and the presence of silver had no obvious
influence on the lattice parameters of ZnO nanoparticles.
When the amount of silver was 2.5 %, the diffraction peaks
of silver were detected at about 33 and 38 degrees in the
XRD spectra of Ag/ZnO. It was further shown that silver
existed on the surface of nano ZnO, instead of Zn binding
site entered the nano ZnO lattice.
When Ag content in Ag/ZnO is low (0.5 %, 1 %, 1.5 %,
2 %), there is no peak related to Ag nanoparticles. That is
because the size of nano-Ag is about 15 nm. Compared with
the size of nano-ZnO (170 nm), the size of nano-Ag is too
small, and the content of Ag deposited on nano-ZnO is too
small, the crystallinity is too low to reach the minimum
detection limit of XRD. When the content of nano-silver is
2.5 %, the minimum detection limit of XRD is reached.
Therefore, the relevant diffraction peaks of nano-silver
appear, but the intensity of the diffraction peaks is too small
[30,31].
Morphology of Ag/ZnO Nanorods
In order to obtain detailed information about the
microstructure and morphology of the sized samples, TEM
observations were carried out. The TEM images of nano
ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanoparticles were shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3(a) was the TEM photograph of ZnO nanoparticles.
The prepared ZnO nanoparticles were rod shaped, with a
length of about 170 nm, a diameter of about 30 nm, and the
surface of prepared ZnO presented a smooth and clean, as
shown in Figure 3(a). Figure 3(b) showing the TEM of Ag/
ZnO when 1.5 % Ag deposited on nano ZnO, For the Ag/
ZnO (Figure 3(b)), it is illustrated that the nano silver
particles deposited on the surface of nano ZnO, the nano

ZnO was rod like morphology and the size remain unchanged.
Silver nanoparticles were spherical with the diameter was
about 15 nm.
UV-vis Absorption Spectrum Analysis
Figure 4 presents the UV-vis absorption spectrum of nano
ZnO and Ag/ZnO recorded in the 190-850 nm wave length
range. All the spectra showed the typical broad absorption of
nano ZnO at around 371 nm [32]. The shift in the absorption
peaks observed lightly towards higher wave length after Ag
deposition. As shown in the figure, the UV-vis absorption
peaks of nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO were around at 371 nm,
compared with theUV-vis absorption peak of nano ZnO.
And the UV-vis absorption intensity of Ag/ZnO was
improved with the increase of silver deposition, the UV
absorption intensity of Ag/ZnO was increased and then
decreased. When the Ag deposition volume was 1.5 %, the
strength of Ag/ZnO to UV-vis absorption was highest, and
the utilization of light was higher. When deposited Ag
amount was more than 1.5 %, an excess of Ag deposited on
the surface of the nano ZnO, reduced the UV-vis absorbance
on the Ag/ZnO. Because the deposition volume of silver
exceeded the detection range of UV-vis spectrophotometer,
the correlation peak of silver was not detected. Therefore,

and Ag/ZnO.

the appropriate amount of Ag increased the UV-vis absorption
performance of nano ZnO [33].
Performance of Cotton Fabric Loaded with Ag/ZnO
Nanorods
Morphology of the Cotton Fabric
The morphology of cotton fabric loaded with ZnO and
2.5 % Ag deposited ZnO were studied by SEM and EDS
shown in Figure 5. Figure 5(a) is the SEM photo of untreated
cotton fabric. And the surface of cotton fabric was smooth
without any particles. Figure 5(d) was the EDS photo of
untreated cotton fabric. Cotton fabric surface mainly
contains C, N, O element but no Ag and Zn.
Figure 5(b) was the SEM images of fabric treated with
nano ZnO, after loaded with nano ZnO, the surface of cotton
fabrics were rough. Figure 5(e) is the EDS images of cotton
fabric treated with nano ZnO, in addition to the C, N, and O
elements, the surface of cotton fiber contained a lot of Zn
elements, but there contained a small amount of silver
impurity.
Figure 5(c) is the SEM images of fabric treated with Ag/
ZnO. After loaded with Ag deposited ZnO, the surface of
cotton fabrics were rough. Figure 5(f) was the EDS images
of fabric treated with Ag/ZnO, the surface of cotton fabric
contained a large number of Zn and Ag elements, indicating
that there was a large amount of Ag/ZnO on the surface of
cotton fabrics.
Hydrophobic Property of Cotton Fabric
Figure 6 presents the contact angle of cotton fabric with
water, load with nano ZnO and Ag deposited ZnO. The
surface is considered as hydrophobic when the contact angle

is greater than 90 o [34]. Cotton fabric possessed excellent
hydrophilicity. From Figure 6 it can be clearly seen that all
the fabric treated with nano ZnO or Ag deposited ZnO was
hydrophobic. The contact angle of fabric coated with ZnO
was 103 o, and the contact angle of fabric loaded with 0.5 %
Ag/ZnO was 107 o. With the depositing amount increased,
the contact angle increased significantly, and it reached to
139 o when Ag content was 3 %, the cotton fabric still has
good hydrophobic property.
The hydrophobicity of textiles refers to the phenomenon
that the contact angle between the surface of textiles and
droplets is greater than 90 o and less than 180 o. The larger
the contact angle, the better the hydrophobicity of textiles.

Generally, hydrophobic surfaces can be achieved by
constructing nanostructures based on hydrophobic bulk
materials. Many scientists have reported the preparation of
hydrophobic textiles with different methods such as making
tiny protrusions with nanoparticles or by chemical treatments.
When nano-silver or nano-zinc oxide acts to individually on
the fabric surface, a nano-scale micro-convex structure will
be formed. Water droplets only contact with the microconvex structure on the fabric surface, and at the same time,
water droplets also have a certain surface tension, thus
forming a hydrophobic effect. Xue et al. [35]. first treated
cotton fabric with sodium hydroxide solution with mass
fraction of 10 %, then dipped cotton fabric in silver-ammonia
solution and obtained nano-silver coated textiles. After
coating, the surface of the textiles was roughened, and the
contact angle was about 153 o, which formed superhydrophobic effect, and also had excellent conductivity and
antimicrobial properties. A similar work done by Ates [36]
showed that ZnO nanowires had been grown on cotton
fabric to impart self-cleaning, superhydrophobicity and
ultraviolet (UV) blocking properties. Therefore, the synergistic
hydrophobicity of nano -silver and nano-zinc oxide can
obviously improve the hydrophobicity of cotton fabric.
UV and Visible Light Absorption
The UV resistance of cotton fabric was researched and
present in Figure 7. Apparently, the pristine cotton fabric
does not display the property of ultraviolet resistance [33],
whose transmittance was above 99 % and the UV
transmittance of fabric coated with nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO
was reduced evidently. The fabric loaded with Ag/ZnO had a
lower UV transmittance than the fabric loaded with
undeposited ZnO. With the increase in depositing amount,
the ultraviolet transmission of cotton fabric reduced, and
minimum reached to 9 % when the depositing amount was
2 %. However, when depositing amount increased to 2.5 %,

the transmission of fabric was increased too, because the
particle size of Ag deposited ZnO had increased which can
be observed in SEM. Both nano ZnO and Ag deposited ZnO
gave cotton fabric an excellent UV resistance.
Antimicrobial Property
The antimicrobial activities of the cotton fabric treated
with ZnO and Ag deposited ZnO were evaluated against
S. aureus, which stands for Gram-positive bacteria. The
E. coli is representative of Gram-negative bacteria and C.
albicans stands for Fungus.
Figure 8 presents the results of antibacterial activities of
the cotton fabric treated with nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO. The
antibacterial rates of fabric laden with nano ZnO against
S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans were 75 %, 82 % and
70 % respectively.
The antibacterial effects of Ag/ZnO treated cotton fabrics
were analyzed on S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans. As the
amount of silver deposition increased, the antimicrobial
rates also gradually increased. In particular, C. albicans had
the fastest growth in antimicrobial growth. When the
deposition of silver was 3 %, the antibacterial amount of C.
albicans was 98 % it was because C. albicans belongs to
kingdom fungi, and its cell structure and the mode of
reproduction has great differences with the gram.
The antibacterial property of nano Ag/ZnO finishing
cotton fabric was better than that of nano ZnO finishing
cotton fabric. Nano Ag/ZnO finishing cotton fabric had a
broad spectrum of antibacterial properties. On the one hand,
Ag+ itself was one of the inorganic nano antibacterial agent,
and used as stripping material for surface adsorption. The
electrostatic effect of Ag+ caused the cell wall of microbe to
deform, and entered the cell, so could react with proteins,
nucleic acids and DNA in bacterial cells, resulted in
destruction of bacterial growth and their reproduction, thus,
playing an antibacterial role. On the other hand, nano ZnO
and Ag destroyed the cell composition of bacteria at the

same time, and can acted as a synergistic antibacterial agent.
Therefore, Ag/ZnO finishing cotton fabric has better
antibacterial effect. With the increase of silver content in
material, increases the antibacterial property of the finished
cotton fabric and enhanced its activity.
Antifungal Property
Figure 9 presents the results of antifungal activities of the
cotton fabric treated with nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO, which
were evaluated against A. flavus. As shown in the diagram, a
large amount of mold growth on Ag/ZnO cotton fabric with
nano ZnO and 0.5 % Ag/ZnO deposition, the results showed
that the finishing of cotton fabric with nano ZnO and 0.5 %
deposition amount of Ag/ZnO had no ability to prevent A.
flavus. When the deposition amount of Ag was more than
1 %, then the area of Ag/ZnO growing on cotton fabric was
gradually reduced, which gives the mildew resistance of
cotton fabric to A. flavus.
Table 2 was the grade of mildew resistance of cotton
fabrics treated with nano ZnO and Ag/ZnO. Cotton fabric
with nano ZnO finishing of A. flavus mildew proof grade 4,
that is, no mildew resistance. When the deposition amount
of Ag was 1 %, Ag/ZnO cotton fabric mildew enhanced the
level to grade 3, the deposition of Ag with cotton fabric
mildew performance. when the deposition amount of Ag
was 2.5 % and 3 %, mildew proof grade cotton the Ag/ZnO
of A. flavus could reach grade 1; with the increase of Ag
content, enhanced Ag/ZnO cotton fabric mildew effect, the

main anti-mildew action in Ag/ZnO was the precipitation of
Ag+.

Conclusion
ZnO and different molar percentages of Ag deposited ZnO
were synthesized by simple chemical precipitation method.
The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by XRD,
UV-vis spectroscopy and SEM. After depositing, the average
grain size is basically the same, and the peak position of the
Ag/ZnO absorption peak is not significantly offset, and the
half-peak height of the peak is basically unchanged. The
prepared nano ZnO was a rod like structure, and the size of
nano ZnO after silver deposition was unchanged. The nano
silver is spherical and deposited on the surface of zinc oxide.
All the samples were loaded on the cotton fabric, ZnO or
Ag/ZnO endows the cotton fabric with excellent hydrophobic
property, UV resistance and broad spectrum antibacterial
activities against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and
fungus. The fabric treated with Ag/ZnO has a better
performance than the fabric loaded with ZnO in the
hydrophobic and UV resistance. Compared with the fabric
loaded with ZnO, the fabric finished with Ag/ZnO has more
effective antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli,
and the antibacterial rates against S. aureus E. coil, and C.
albicans of fabric with 3 % Ag/ZnO were promoted to 91 %,
96 % and 98 %, moreover, Ag/ZnO gave the mildew

An extensive study on using plant waste aqueous extracts as natural chemicals for in-situ synthesis of zinc oxide
(ZnO) on cotton is presented. Reducing agents were prepared from green tea leaves (GT), pomegranate peels
(PG), and staghorn sumac leaves (SsL) and drupes (SsD), and the alkaline medium from discarded wood ash. Zinc
acetate was found to be more appropriate precursor than zinc nitrate. Formation of ZnO on cotton was confirmed
by energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence results showed the highest amount of ZnO
on cotton was formed using PG and SsL extracts, which was also confirmed with scanning electron microscopy
and UV/visible spectroscopy. The ZnO-functionalised samples exhibited excellent UV-blocking ability and
different wetting properties (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) depending on the reducing agent used due to their
different total phenolic content. This study shows that by choosing the plant waste source as a reducing agent for
ZnO formation directly on cotton, the properties of cotton can be designed to be hydrophilic or hydrophobic with
excellent UV-blocking properties. The XRD results of ex-situ synthesis prove that the short reaction time enables
the formation of ZnO.

1. Introduction
Modifying textile materials is essential in order to design their pro­
tective and functional properties, i.e., protection against ultraviolet (UV)
radiation and hydrophobicity. The modified textile materials can be
used in the automotive industry, agricultural and food packaging,
sports, military, and outdoor work clothing. Coating textiles with zinc
oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) or other nanostructures can provide
UV-blocking, photocatalytic self-cleaning, and antimicrobial, hydro­
phobic, and flame-retardant properties [1–10]. However, the classical
nano-chemical preparation of ZnO involves the use of toxic chemicals,
long reaction times for synthesis, and high calcination temperatures,
which are not environmentally friendly and are time- and energyconsuming, resulting in high costs. Two important factors that lead to
a more benign process are the in-situ synthesis of nanoparticles, which
means direct synthesis on a textile material, [11–15] and the use of
phytochemicals from biodegradable waste in the in-situ synthesis pro­
cess [16,17]. Biodegradable wastes, such as agricultural, garden, and

park wastes, food, and kitchen wastes from households, restaurants,
caterers, and retail premises, are currently considered as low-value
materials. Although 40% of biowaste is recycled into high-quality
compost, the rest could play an important role in the future potential
of a circular economy [18]. Because of the high content of bioactive
compounds in plants, the extracts from waste plant materials (i.e., fruit
peels, wasted tea leaves, drupes, and leaves of invasive plants) [19,20]
should be considered as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective
substitute for classical reducing agents, solving the problem of using
harsh and toxic chemicals in ZnO synthesis and textile application
processes. Although much progress has been attained in green in-situ
synthesis of ZnO on textiles [21,22], the use of classical chemicals
such as alkali sources (NaOH or KOH), which are essential for the suc­
cessful reduction of zinc salt to ZnO, still persists. Only a few completely
green in-situ ZnO syntheses have been performed directly on textiles.
Some examples used ash from burned leaves and stems of the Seidlitzia
Rosmarinus plant on cotton [23] and on polyester [24]. Others used
pomegranate peels and wood ash [25] and Japanese knotweed leaves

and wood ash on cotton [26]. Therefore, a completely green process for
in-situ ZnO synthesis must be researched further. While the exact
mechanism of green ZnO synthesis not fully understood, the researchers
assume that metabolites from the plants are able to act as a reducing,
capping and stabilising agents [16,27]. It was reported many times that
the presence of phenolic compounds in the natural extract is crucial for
the synthesis to be successful [28–30]. Furthermore, phenolic com­
pounds with large number of hydroxyl groups are supposed to have good
antioxidant properties [31] and antioxidants are commonly good re­
ductants [32,33]. In the first step of the synthesis, the cotton fabric is
immersed into alkaline solution, which causes swelling of the cotton
fibres resulting in a stronger partial anionization of cellulosic hydroxy
groups, which provide additional adsorption sites for chemicals on the
surface of cotton fabric [34,35]. This enables better adsorption of zinc in
the second step of the synthesis, when the cotton sample is immersed
into zinc precursor. Adsorbed zinc ions act as a nucleation sites for the
ZnO nanoparticles. In the third step of the synthesis, natural plant
extract containing a large amount of phenolic compounds (containing −
OH groups) is introduced. Finally, the sample is subjected to drying and
curing process, in which the unnecessary hydrogen is withdrawn.
Our research, which used plant waste extracts instead of classical
chemicals, follows the European Green Deal strategy with its key prin­
ciples concerning environmentally friendly waste management, their
transformation into secondary materials, and the orientation toward a
chemical-free environment [36]. The plant materials used in our
research were wastes of green tea leaves, pomegranate peels, leaves and
drupes of staghorn sumac.
Green tea is produced from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, which
originates in China [37]. Commonly determined compounds in green tea
leaves are phenols, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and
vitamins C and E [29]. The primary polyphenols found in green tea are
flavanols or catechins, which constitute 30–40 % of the extractable
solids of dried green tea leaves [38,39]. Catechins are strong scavengers
of free radicals and oxidants with very effective UV-absorbing abilities
[16,40]. Senthilkumar et al. discovered that proteins, lipids, and amino
acids in green tea help stabilise nanoparticle growth and prevent
agglomeration [29]. Pomegranate (Punica granatum) belongs to the
family Punicaceae. It originated from Persia but is now cultivated
worldwide because of its adaptability to all types of soils and climates
[41]. The pomegranate market has very high consumer demand
worldwide, with production estimated at 2,000,000 metric tonnes
annually [42] and increasing. Pomegranate peels comprise 26–30 % of
the total fruit weight and contain phenolic compounds such as flavo­
noids (anthocyanins, catechins, etc.) and tannins (punicalagin, gallic
acid, ellagic acid, etc.) [43]. Staghorn sumac is native to North America
and is considered an invasive alien plant in Europe [44]. The invasive
alien plants are burned annually and removed from the environment.
According to the European Commission, management action is needed
to prevent further spread of invasive plants and minimise the damage
they cause [45]. However, the drupes of staghorn sumac are rich in
phytochemicals, with as many as 211 different compounds identified
[46]. Among others, oleic, linoleic, gallic, ellagic, and caftaric acid,
catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, vitamins, and minerals [47–50] have
been detected in drupes and leaves, making them excellent candidates
for reducing agents. Some of these plant materials have already been
successfully used as reducing agents for the formation of different
nanoparticles. Green tea has been the most commonly used source for
the green synthesis of silver (Ag) [16,51–53] and gold (Au) [51].
However, the majority of procedures were performed ex-situ, that is, the
nanoparticles were first synthesised and then applied to textiles
[51–53]. Extensive research has been conducted in which Ag nano­
particles were synthesised in-situ on cotton using green tea, pome­
granate peels, staghorn sumac drupes, and other extracts [16] without
the use of any additional chemicals. Pomegranate peel extract was used
for in-situ Ag synthesis on cotton [17] and ex-situ on wool [54], as well
as for the in-situ synthesis of ZnO on cotton [25]. Silver nanoparticles

were synthesised in-situ on cotton pretreated with polysiloxane [55] and
sol–gel matrix [56] using staghorn sumac leaf extract. In the green insitu synthesis of ZnO using Japanese knotweed as a reducing agent, it
was found that choosing the correct protocol for the successful forma­
tion of nanoparticles was essential [26].
In this paper, we present for the first time an extensive study on
various plant wastes as reducing agents for the in-situ synthesis of ZnO
on cotton fabric. The synthesis enables UV-protective and hydrophilic/
hydrophobic fabric design. Besides the zinc precursor, no other chem­
icals were used in the synthesis process. Instead, natural extracts, which
act as an alkaline medium and a reducing agent, were prepared.
Furthermore, all extracts were prepared in water; therefore, no volatile
solvents were used. The application was performed at room temperature
with very short treatment times, e.g., 1 min. Because the synthesis was
performed directly on cotton fabric, low drying temperatures were used
(100 ◦ C) with no calcination of ZnO-NPs at extremely high tempera­
tures. The aim of this study was to investigate which inedible byproducts of food production or invasive alien plants are suitable for
use as reducing agents and how the use of different precursors and
reducing agents influences the properties of the synthesised particles
and functionalised cotton fabric. The untreated and functionalised cot­
ton fabric samples were analysed for their physical, chemical,
morphological and functional properties.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Materials
Plain weaved, chemically bleached and mercerised cotton (weight:
110 g/m2, number of warp threads: 60 threads/cm, number of weft
threads: 32 threads/cm), (Tekstina d.d., Ajdovščina, Slovenia), zinc
acetate dihydrate (Honeywell, NC, USA) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate
(Sigma-Aldrich, Misuri, USA) were used in this study.
2.2. Preparation of natural extracts
The leaves of green tea (GT), peels of pomegranate fruits (PG), leaves
(SsL) and drupes (SsD) of Staghorn sumac were used in the study. For
green tea extract, commercially available green tea was used (Podravka,
Koprivnica, Croatia). Pomegranate fruit peels were washed with
distilled water and air-dried. Staghorn sumac leaves were harvested and
air-dried. The plant material was then ground into powder using a
kitchen blender. Staghorn sumac drupes were collected and stored in a
freezer. Before preparing the extract, the drupes were manually sepa­
rated from the stem and used as received. The natural extracts were
prepared as in Verbič et al. 2021 [25]; however, twice the lower con­
centration of the plant material was used (50 g/L). The procedure is
schematically presented in Fig. 1. The pH of the plant extracts are re­
ported in Table 1.
The alkaline medium used for the in-situ synthesis of ZnO was a
natural extract from wood ash waste, prepared by the same procedure as
described in Verbič et al. 2021 [25]. The measured pH of the ash extract
was 11. The procedure is schematically presented in Fig. 2.
2.3. In-situ synthesis of ZnO-NPs on cotton fabric
For the in-situ synthesis of ZnO, cotton samples were immersed in
three different active solutions for synthesis: wood ash extract, zinc
precursor, and plant extract (Fig. 3). All samples were immersed in each
active solution for synthesis for 1 min and dried in a continuous flow
dryer. After immersion in the wood ash extract, samples were dried for 2
min, and after immersion in the plant extract or zinc precursor, samples
were dried for 5 min. Finally, all samples were dried in a laboratory oven
at 100 ◦ C for 30 min and cured at 150 ◦ C for 5 min. Two different zinc
precursors were used, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc nitrate hexahy­
drate at 0.5 M concentration. Each synthesis was carried out using each

2.5. Analyses
2.5.1. UV protection factor measurements
The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of cotton fabric samples was
determined according to the test method AATCC TM 183 [57]. Mea­
surements were performed using a Varian CARY 1E UV/VIS spectro­
photometer (Varian, Australia). The transmission of ultraviolet
radiation through samples was measured in the spectral range between
280 and 400 nm and the UPF was calculated according to the following
equation:
∑400
∑400
⋅Eλ ⋅Sλ ⋅Δλ
⋅Eλ⋅Sλ⋅Δλ
(1)
UPF = ∑400λ=280
∑400λ=280
λ=280 ⋅Eλ ⋅Sλ ⋅Tλ ⋅Δλ
λ=280 ⋅Eλ⋅Sλ⋅Tλ⋅Δλ
where Eλ is the relative erythermal spectral effectiveness, Sλ is the
solar spectral irradiance, Tλ is the spectral transmittance of the sample,
and Δλ is the measured wavelength interval in nm. The UVR protection
categories were determined from the calculated UPF values according to
the Australian/New Zealand Standard: Sun Protective Clothing – Eval­
uation and Classification [58].

the extract with centrifugation, 5) vacuum filtering to acquire a clear solution

2.5.2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS)
SEM and EDS analysis of the untreated and ZnO-functionalised cot­
ton samples was performed using Quanta 650 scanning electron mi­
croscope operated in low-vacuum mode at 70 Pa, therefore no coating
was needed. It has a tungsten filament, excellent analytical current of up
to 2000nA, and the latest state of the art Oxford Live EDS Ultim max 40
mm2 SDD detector. The average mean size of the particles was measured
from the obtained SEM micrographs using ImageJ programme [59,60].

2.5.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS instrument (Physical Electronics, Ismaning, Germany) was used
to obtain the elemental composition of the surface, expressed in atomic
percent (at. %). The seeds were placed onto the sample holder, which
was placed inside the XPS and allowed to dry for an hour in the chamber
before analysis. The samples were excited by X-ray radiation from a
monochromatic Al source at a photon energy of 1486.6 eV. The area
analysed was 400 μm2. The take-off angle was set at 45◦ . XPS surveyscan spectra were acquired at a pass-energy of 187 eV using an energy
step of 0.4 eV. Spectra were analysed using the MultiPak V8.0 software
(Ulvac-phi, Inc., Chigasaki, Japan). All measurements were performed
in duplicate, and a mean value and standard error were calculated.
2.5.4. X-ray flourescence (XRF)
A ThermoFisher Scientific portable XRF analyzer NITON XL5 + was
used to determine the qualitative / quantitative elements of the four
cotton samples. Each fabric sample was measured on both sides (front/
back) using the integrated mining module. Due to insufficient thickness
of the sample, a 3 cm thick crystal of pure quartz was placed behind the
cotton sample. We measured for 180 s with three filters (main, low and
high). The results of the XRF analysis are given in the form of spectra
(two spectra for each sample), which were compared on the basis of the
intensity of the Zn X-ray lines.

ashes of burnt commercial wood pellets used for the heating system, 2) mixing

of the four plant extracts separately.
2.4. Ex-situ synthesis of ZnO powders
The ex-situ synthesis of ZnO powders was carried out by the same
procedure as the in-situ synthesis of ZnO on cotton. The sequence of
synthesis solutions, synthesis time and drying temperature were the
same. Wood ash extract was added to a beaker, and after 1 min of
magnetic stirring, the zinc acetate solution was added. After stirring for
1 min, the plant extract (GT, PG, SsL or SsD) was added. Immediately
after the addition of the extract, the formation of a precipitate was
observed. The suspension was further stirred for 1 min. The asynthesized
ZnO samples were obtained by centrifugation, additionally filtered and
dried in a laboratory oven at 100 ◦ C and at 150 ◦ C for 5 min. The samples
were finely ground and calcined at 400 ◦ C for 2 h to obtain fine powders.

2.5.5. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Cotton samples were cut into squares measuring 2 × 1 cm2. Each
sample was placed in an aluminium holder and allign with a glass plate
to level the surface of the sample with the surface of the holder. Ex-situ
synthesised ZnO powders and pure crystalline corundum NIST-676a
were inserted into the aluminium holder as well and aligned with a
glass plate to level the holder surface. A Philips PW3710 X-ray diffrac­
tometer was used with Cu-Kα1 1.54060 Å radiation generated at 40 kV
and 30 mA. The samples were scanned at a rate of 3◦ per minute, over
the range of 3◦ to 70◦ (2Theta). The diffraction patterns were identified
with X’Pert HighScore Plus software ver. 4.8.

2.5.6. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
Cotton samples where in-situ synthesis was performed using natural
plant extracts were analysed by mass spectrometry with inductively
coupled plasma after microwave digestion using Agilent Technologies
7500ce ICP mass spectrometry (MS) instrument. All reagents used were
of analytical grade or better. For sample dilution and preparation of
standards, ultrapure water (MilliQ, Millipore) and ultrapure acids
(HNO3 and HCl, Merck-Suprapure) were used. Standards were prepared
in-house by dilution of certified, traceable, inductively coupled plasma
(ICP)-grade single-element standards (Merck CertiPUR). An Agilent
Technologies 7900 ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) instrument, equipped
with a MicroMist glass concentric nebuliser and Peltier-cooled, Scott
type spray chamber was used. Prior to ICP-MS analysis, each sample was
weighted (approximately 100 mg) and digested using a microwaveassisted digestion system (CEM MDS-2000) in a solution of 6 mL
hidrochloric acid and 2 mL nitric acid. The digested samples were cooled
to room temperature and then diluted with 2 %v/v nitric acid until their
concentration was within the desired concentration range prior to
analysis.

2.5.9. Water contact angles (WCA) measurements
WCA measurements were performed with a drop shape analyser DSA
100E (Krüss, Germany) to determine the surface wettability. Instrument
is fully motorized in all three directions with high-resolution camera and
a quality zoom lens for accurate display of the drop with optimum size.
An average value of three measurements on different locations on the
cotton samples is presented.

2.5.7. Colour measurements
CIE L*a*b* values of the sample were measured using Spectraflash
600 PLUS-CT reflectance spectrophotometer (Datacolor, Luzern,
Switzerland). The colour strength (K/S values) was calculated from the
reflectance measurement according to equation (2):

2.5.10. Total phenolic content (TPC) analysis
The Folin–Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total
phenolic content of.
natural extracts [62]. Clear supernatants (0.5 mL) were transferred
to test tubes and Folin–Ciocalteu agent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) (2.5 mL) was added to each tube. After 3 min, 2 mL of 20 %
Na2CO3 solution was added, and the mixture was kept in dark for 2 h.
Absorbance values were measured by a UV/Vis spectrophotometer
(Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 760 nm. A linear
calibration curve was obtained with gallic acid, and results were
expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g of the sample.

Successful reduction of zinc salt to ZnO directly on a cotton fabric
was achieved using natural reducing agents and an alkaline medium.
Natural reducing agents were prepared from four biodegradable waste
plant materials, such as wasted green tea leaves (GT), pomegranate peels
(PG), staghorn sumac leaves (SsL) and drupes (SsD), and an alkaline
medium from ashes of burned wood pallets. Initial trials involved using
two different zinc precursors, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc nitrate
hexahydrate. When preparing the functionalised cotton samples for
analysis, some samples were very fragile during handling. This was
observed with the samples prepared using 0.5 M zinc nitrate hexahy­
drate as the precursor. Therefore, the mechanical properties of func­
tionalised cotton fabrics were analysed first because any new textile
modification process should not worsen the mechanical properties of the
fabric. The results of the tensile strength and tensile elongation of the
functionalised cotton fabrics are shown in Fig. 4. The untreated cotton
fabric had a tensile strength of 181.2 ± 2.2 N and an extension of 21.3 ±
0.2 %. The functionalised cotton samples with in-situ prepared ZnO from
zinc nitrate hexahydrate were substantially weakened, with a tensile
strength between 84.1 ± 9.9 to 34.4 ± 16.8 N and elongation ranging
from 11.0 ± 1.0 to 7.6 ± 5.3% (Fig. 4). The functionalised cotton fabrics
with in-situ prepared ZnO from zinc acetate dihydrate using the same

where R represents the reflectance, K means the absorbance, and S
represents the scattering of the sample.
2.5.8. Mechanical properties
Breaking strength (N) and elongation (%) of untreated and func­
tionalised fabrics were analysed with Instron 5567 in accordance to
standard ISO 13934–1:2013 [61] with slight modifications. Cotton
samples of dimensions 50 mm × 25 mm were analysed using a preloading of 1 N and a speed of 50 mm/min. Before measurements, sam­
ples were conditioned at 25 ◦ C and 65 % air humidity for 24 h. Two
pieces in weft direction were cut from each sample. The breaking
strength and elongation were read at the breaking point of the test
sample and the average was calculated.

drupes (SsD).

plant extracts remained tough or were even stronger, with tensile
strength values between 175.6 ± 5.2 and 189.1 ± 7.0 N and elongation
ranging from 14.0 ± 0.1 to 20.3 ± 1.6%. An industrially important
feature of cellulosic fibres is chemical stability, enabling them to with­
stand degradation [63]. Since cotton is sensitive to low pH and degrades
under acidic conditions due to the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages
[64], the pH of both precursors was measured. The pH of the 0.5 M zinc
nitrate hexahydrate solution was 3.64, while that of the 0.5 M zinc ac­
etate dihydrate was 6.14. Therefore, zinc nitrate dihydrate was not
suitable for the in-situ synthesis of ZnO on cellulose materials. Cotton
fabrics with such poor mechanical properties could not be used in any
application; hence, the samples prepared with the zinc nitrate hexahy­
drate precursor were excluded from further study.
The functional properties of the cotton fabrics were further analysed
to determine their UV-protection factor (UPF) and wettability. The re­
sults are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 5.
The UPF values of the samples were mainly influenced by the type of
natural extract used in the synthesis process (Table 2). All the func­
tionalised fabrics had excellent protection against UV radiation. The
UPF value was determined by the Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/
NZS 4399: 2017 [58]. The values were classified into three groups,
depending on the percentage of UV radiation blocked. The higher the
UPF value, the better is the UV-blocking ability of the sample. The UPF
value 15–30 is considered as minimal, 30–50 as good, and above 50 as
excellent UV protection. When a fabric is assigned an excellent UPF, it
means that the fabric blocks over 98 % of UVA and UVB radiation. The
highest UV protection was achieved when the cotton sample was func­
tionalised with in-situ synthesised ZnO using SsL extract as a reducing
agent. This sample achieved a UPF value of 1010.9. The cotton fabric
with the second-highest UPF value was obtained through in-situ syn­
thesis of ZnO using PG extract as a reducing agent (UPF = 277.6), fol­
lowed by a sample where GT extract was used as a reducing agent (UPF
= 108.9), and finally a sample where SsD extract was used as reducing
agent (UPF = 60.9). The untreated cotton sample had an average WCA

of 57.81 ± 0.87◦ , which means that the water was easily absorbed into
the cotton, and the fabric was hydrophilic (Fig. 5). The other samples all
had higher contact angles, with values ranging from 75.82 ± 6.94 to
137.82 ± 4.93◦ . While the sample where the ZnO was synthesised in-situ
using PG extract was the only hydrophilic one (WCA = 75.82 ± 6.94◦ ),
all other functionalised samples showed increased hydrophobicity.
Interestingly, the samples with the highest UPF values (SsL and PG) had
the lowest measured contact angles.
The physical, chemical and morphological properties of the un­
treated and functionalised cotton fabrics were analysed using SEM, EDS,
XPS, XRD, XRF, ICP-MS and reflectance spectroscopy to gain insight into
the phenomena that caused these high UV-protective properties and
different wettability.
The SEM and EDS results are shown in Fig. 6. All the functionalised
samples had various nanostructures visible on the fibre surface, which
were confirmed to be ZnO by EDS. The use of different natural extracts
as reducing agents in the in-situ synthesis process influenced the
morphology, size, and amount of ZnO nanostructures formed on cotton
fabrics. The cotton fibres of the ZnO-functionalised samples were coated
with several dense layers of ZnO (Fig. 6). The morphology of the
nanoparticles is spherical-like, with fine grains. The average size of the
in-situ synthetised ZnO particles on cotton fabric was measured from the
obtained SEM micrographs using ImageJ programme (Table 3). The size
of the in-situ synthesized particles varied between 113.5 nm (for GT
extract) and 205.0 nm (for SsL extract). In the studies of ex-situ synthesis
of ZnO nanoparticles it was found that size and morpholgy of the “green”
synthesised ZnO particles is influenced by the synthesis parameters,
such as temperature, duration of synthesis, ratio between synthesis so­
lutions, method used, pH of the solutions, type and content of the
phenolic compounds in the plant extract and tendency of nanoparticles
towards agglomeration [65–67]. Fewer ZnO particles were formed with
SsD than with SsL, as some parts of the cotton fibres were not covered
with ZnO. The EDS analysis confirmed that the sample using SsD con­
tained a lesser amount of Zn (9.0%) than that of SsL (28.4%). The

highest Zn content was found in the sample that used PG (34.0%) and
the lowest in sample that used GT (8.4%).
XPS analysis was performed to confirm that the structures on the
fibres were indeed ZnO. The survey spectra of the untreated and func­
tionalised samples are shown in Fig. 7. The atomic % of Zn in the
samples varied from 3 to 5%. The lowest at. % of Zn (~3%) was found
for GT sample and the highest at. % of Zn (~5%) for PG sample. No zinc
was present on the untreated sample. The XPS spectrum of the untreated
cotton showed the main peaks of C 1 s and O 1 s at 285 and 533 eV,
respectively. The functionalised cotton samples exhibited additional
peaks due to Zn 2p3,2p1 doublet, with the positions of the Zn 2p3 and Zn
2p1 peaks at 1021.3 and 1021.9 eV, respectively, corresponding to Zn2+
[68]. The Zn 3 s, 3p, and 3d peaks are positioned at binding energies of
140, 90, and 10 eV, whereas the position of the most intense Zn LMM
Auger peak is at 495 eV. The spectrum shape of the Zn LMM Auger
structure resembles that of the ZnO spectrum. Our results agree with
those obtained by other researchers studying the application of ZnO on
cotton. Uğur et al. [69] prepared a ZnO nanoparticle assembly on cotton
fabrics through a layer-by-layer deposition process. They examined the
elemental composition of untreated and nanocomposite multilayer films
on cotton fabrics using XPS. The survey spectra of cotton fabrics
deposited with ZnO-NPs showed a peak of Zn 2p at 1021 eV and Zn
LMM, along with the C 1 s and O 1 s peaks of the untreated sample,
proving the immobilisation of ZnO nanoparticles onto cotton fabrics.
The same phenomenon was observed by El-Nahhal et al. [70], in which
ZnO-NPs were prepared and deposited onto cotton fibres via ultrasound
irradiation.
XRD analysis was used to determine the structure of the crystalline
structure of ZnO on cotton. Fig. 8 shows the cotton samples where the insitu synthesis of ZnO was performed using GT, PG, SsL, and SsD extracts.
Characteristic peaks for cotton were observed at 2θ ≈ 14, 16, 22, and
34◦ , consistent with the results obtained by other groups [71–75]. The
peaks around 31, 34, and 36◦ can be ascribed to the (0 1 0), (0 0 2), and

(0 1 1) crystal planes of ZnO, respectively, confirming the hexagonal
wurtzite structure [11,75,76]. In our case, only one broad peak with low
intensity was detected at approximately 34◦ , corresponding to the cot­
ton peak. No other peaks were visible around 34◦ , which could mean
that our ZnO was amorphous or the content was too low to be detected
by XRD analyses. Zhang et al. and Asakuma et al. [77,78] have previ­
ously reported that amorphous ZnO is formed at temperatures below
150 ◦ C, which is why distinct ZnO crystallite peaks are not visible in the
spectrum. High temperatures are required to transform to crystalline
hexagonal ZnO, which results in peaks whose intensity increases with
increasing temperature [76,79–81]. Heating at high temperatures (i.e.
from 300 ◦ C) was not feasible in our case because the synthesis was
performed directly on the cotton fabric, which would disintegrate at
very high temperatures. The advantages of amorphous ZnO materials
have already been discussed by Lin et al. [82]. The authors found that
amorphous ZnO are synthesised at low temperatures and have excellent
thermoelectric properties. However, the bandgap of amorphous ZnO is
smaller than that of crystalline ZnO. While there are also some

disadvantages of crystalline ZnO (such as low hardness and poor elec­
trical conductivity), they also have good thermal stability and high
piezoelectric tensors [82–89].
Ex-situ synthesis of ZnO (synthesis without the cotton fabric) was
performed to confirm that our synthesis method and short treatment
time indeed produced ZnO particles. The XRD spectra of the ex-situ
synthesised ZnO powders are shown in Fig. 9. All the detected peaks
are characteristic peaks of crystalline ZnO in the form of zincite, ac­
cording to ICSD-98–000-9346. From the spectra, it can be seen that the
use of different plant extracts as reducing agents affects the intensity of
the peaks. It is known that the sharpness and narrowness of the
diffraction peaks indicate the crystal quality [90,91], i.e., sharp and
narrow peaks mean higher crystallinity. In our case, the lowest and
broadest peaks are observed with the extract of GT. Sharper and more
intense peaks are observed when using the extracts PG, SsL and SsD,
which means that the use of these extracts as reducing agents leads to
higher crystallinity of the synthesised ZnO. Moreover, our spectra do not
contain any additional peaks (which would not be characteristic for
ZnO), which means that the ZnO powder is free from impurities [92] and
pure ZnO was obtained. Short reacton time was also studied by Molefe
et al. [93] where ZnO were chemically synthetised without the presence
of textile substrate. After combining the synthesis reagents in the beaker,
the beakers were added to water bath at an elevated temperature. The
white precipitates were formed within 30 s. The beakers were removed
from the water bath at various time intervals (1, 3, 5, 10 min). Syn­
thesised particles were confirmed to be ZnO by XRD analysis. Mog­
haddam et al. [94] synthesised ZnO nanopowder using a chemical
method. After mixing the synthesis reagents, the final solution was
heated up to 80 ◦ C. After 5 min, the precipitate was centrifuged, dried
and calcinated. The XRD analysis confirmed that the obtained powder is
ZnO with good crystalline structure.
ICP-MS and XRF analyses were performed to analyse the amount of
Zn in the cotton samples in which ZnO was synthesised in-situ. The
concentration of Zn in the cotton samples is presented in Table 5. The
XRF intensity spectra on the energy interval between 7.2 and 10.4
showing Zn energy for Ka1, Ka2, and Kb1 X-ray lines with percentage
intensity are presented in Fig. 10. Again, the highest amount of ZnO was
found in the PG sample, followed by the SsL sample. The lowest amount
of Zn was found in the samples using GT and SsD. These results agree
with the UV/Vis results (Table 2) and EDS (Fig. 6). The PG and SsL
samples, which had the highest amount of ZnO nanostructures, had the

highest UPFs. The SsL sample, in which the nanoparticles were stacked
on top of each other, had much higher UV protection than that of the PG
sample, in which layered, flaky ZnO structures were present (Fig. 6).
Small nanoparticles have high activity because of their large specific
surface area [95–98]. Studies have shown that textiles functionalised
with nanoparticles exhibit higher UV-protective properties when
nanoparticles are smaller, not agglomerated, or form short nanorods
[99,100]. The colour of the textiles could be another factor influencing
the UV-protection ability [37,101–103]. The colour yield (K/S) of the
untreated and functionalised cotton fabrics was evaluated (Table 2). The
K/S values indicate the colour strength of a sample; a high value in­
dicates that the sample contains a high amount of the colourant
[104–106]. The highest K/S value was obtained for the PG sample (K/S
= 9.65), indicating the highest amount of colourant on the sample.
However, this sample did not have the highest UV-protection factor.
Moreover, the sample with the highest UPF had a much lower K/S value
(2.91), even lower than that of GT (K/S = 5.34), which had an even
lower UPF than that of the PG sample. Comparing the UPF and K/S
values of the samples, it is clear that the samples with the highest UPF
values did not have the highest K/S values, and the samples with high K/
S values did not have the highest protection against UV radiation.
Therefore, the ability of our samples to block UV radiation corresponded
with the presence and morphology of ZnO formed on the fibres.
The presence of ZnO nanostructures and their morphology influence
the wettability of surfaces [107–111]. It is usually assumed that the
increased roughness of the sample leads to increased hydrophobicity
[108]. However, Thi et al. [109] reported that theoretically, high sur­
face roughness increases the contact angle owing to trapped air. In
addition, they also discovered that the increased ZnO layer thickness
increased the roughness of the cotton fabric, which further increased the
polar interaction with water droplets (manifested as decreased contact
angle). Similar results were obtained in the present study. When ZnO
was synthesised using PG and SsL extracts, the samples exhibited the
lowest contact angles and had the thickest ZnO layer of all the func­
tionalised samples. The observations were based on SEM and confirmed
by ICP-MS, XRF, and EDS. Other researchers also reported that the
change in morphology (e.g., length, density, and diameter) of the ZnO
nanostructures plays a major role in inducing changes in the waterrepellent properties of coated fabrics [112,113]. Sakai et al. [114]
discovered that ZnO nanorods with smaller diameters induced higher
hydrophobicity. Han and Gao [115] showed that ZnO nanorod films are
more hydrophobic than nanograin films, presumably due to more
trapped air between the sample and the liquid. However, from our re­
sults, we can assume that besides morphology, another important factor
that could influence the wettability is the remaining hydroxyl groups
from the natural extract bound on the ZnO surface. He and Wang [116]
studied the water repellency of differently prepared ZnO nanorod arrays
and found that under a given surface roughness, fewer hydroxyl groups
on ZnO produced pronounced surface hydrophobicity. If the ZnO con­
tained more hydroxyl groups, the surface was more hydrophilic. In our
case, the hydroxyl groups on ZnO originated from the natural extracts
used as reducing agents in the synthesis process. Natural extracts have
different amounts of phenolic compounds, and consequently, different

extract remained on the surface of ZnO, as indicated by wettability
measurements. Akbal et al. [123] found that the reaction rates for the
formation of nanoparticles using different plant extracts are indeed
time-dependent processes, where some plant extracts complete the re­
action faster than others, ultimately depending on the TPC of the plant
extract. This could be taken as an advantage when designing the prop­
erties of the final product to decide which plant extract to use. The plant
extract with high total phenolic content results in a hydrophilic or less
hydrophobic cotton fabric with extremely high UV protection, suitable
for use as protective clothing in summer or in high humidity areas where
moisture management and extremely high UV protection is desired. The
plant extract with low total phenolic content results in hydrophobic
cotton fabric, but with excellent UV blocking ability. The fabric could be
used when a high degree of hydrophobicity is desired, such as in textiles
for food packaging.

sizes and morphologies of ZnO were formed according to plant sources
[117]. In the green synthesis of ZnO on cotton, the formation of ZnO
from the zinc precursor is governed by the hydroxyl groups of poly­
phenols in the plant extract and newly accessible hydroxyl groups from
cellulose due to the swelling of fibres under alkaline conditions
[25,118,119]. There is a significant correlation between antioxidant
activity (AA) and total phenolic content (TPC), but no correlation was
evident between AA and total flavonoid content (TFC) in the natural
extracts [120,121]. The AA of phenolics is mainly due to their redox
properties, which make them act as reducing agents [120]. The plant
extracts used as reducing agents in this research were therefore analysed
for their phenolic content expressed as gallic acid equivalents
[16,62,120,122] (Table 6).
The highest TPC was measured in SsL and PG extracts. The TPC
values of both extracts were very high, with values above 14,000 and
11000 mg of gallic acid equivalent per 100 g of sample. As discussed
above, the functionalised cotton fabrics with in-situ synthesised ZnO
using these two extracts as reducing agents had the highest amount of
ZnO and the highest UPF, but also the lowest water contact angles
(hydrophilic). The extracts of GT and SsD had TPC values of 6103.2 and
1769.4, respectively, and the functionalised cotton fabrics with in-situ
synthesised ZnO using these two extracts had the lowest amount of
ZnO and the lowest UV protection, but with the highest water contact
angles (hydrophobic). This means that in the case of using GT or SsD in
the synthesis process, most polyphenolic compounds in the extracts
were consumed for the formation of ZnO. A higher amount of poly­
phenols (Table 4) in the plant extract led to the formation of a higher
amount of ZnO, as confirmed by EDS, XRF, and ICP-MS. Nevertheless,
under the same synthesis conditions, many of the hydroxyl groups of the

4. Conclusion
This article presented a comprehensive study of fully green in-situ
synthesis of ZnO on cotton that enables the design of fabrics with
preferred protective and functional properties. Reducing agents and
alkali source were prepared from plant wastes derived from food pro­
cessing (green tea, pomegranate), invasive alien plant species (staghorn
sumac), and heating (wood ash). The cotton samples were analysed by
UV/Vis, WCA, K/S, SEM, EDS, XPS, XRD, XRF, and ICP-MS, proving the
synthesis of amorphous ZnO on cotton with different morphologies and
amounts according to the reducing agent used. The ex-situ synthesis of
ZnO powder confirmed the short reaction time indeed produces ZnO.
The TPC of the plant extracts was also analysed. The results showed that
the in-situ synthesis of ZnO with plant extracts having high TPC (PG and
SsL) resulted in high concentrations of ZnO on the fabric, providing
exceptionally high UV protection (UPF = 277.6 and 1010.9), but also a
more hydrophilic cotton surface. Synthesis of ZnO with plant extracts
with low TPC (GT and SsD) led to lower concentrations of ZnO on the
cotton, resulting in a fabric with excellent UV protection (UPF = 108.9
and 60.9) and a hydrophobic surface. This study provides innovative
waste management for environmentally friendly and cost-effective
chemicals for direct ZnO synthesis on cotton, whose unique properties
can be designed according to the desired application. Further studies

A facile method, cost-eﬀective and highly eﬃcient with shortened-time operation was devised for unprecedented
modiﬁcation of cotton fabrics. This modiﬁcation induced the formation of metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles within cotton fabrics in such a way that cotton samples loaded with AgNPs- or AgNPs/ZnONPs or
AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs respectively. Presence of the trimetallic nanoparticles concomitantly within microstructural features of cotton imparts durable antibacterial, UV protection and conductivity properties to yield
ultimately cotton fabrics with multifunctional performance. The nanoparticles were formed and stabilized independently by Polymethylol compound (PMC) and functionalized polyethyleneimine (FPEI) as per one bath.
The results obtained proved that the solution of these metal compounds are turned from colourless to yellow and
black green colour up on addition of PMC or FPEI compound. It was found that UV–vis spectra display maximum
surface plasmon peak of around 410–415 conﬁrming the successful synthesis of AgNPs stabilized by PMC or FPEI
chains. In addition, the results obtained indicated that the as formed nanoparticles are successfully deposited
into the surface of cellulose fabrics and reveal changes in crystalline structure. Fabrics underwent structural
changes during their treatments as per the designed practice exhibit multifunctional properties and manifold
performance. The resultant treated cotton fabric gives good antibacterial properties event after 20 washing
cycles additionally to the excellent ultra-violet properties and excellent electrical conductivity.

1. Introduction
Commercial textile products of the market comprise apparel, domestic textiles and technical textiles. Meanwhile, the textile materials
are divided into ﬁbrous and nonﬁbrous textile materials. Fibrous textiles are known as cotton, wool, past ﬁbres, polyester and polyamide
whereas nonﬁbrous identiﬁed as textile auxiliaries and ﬁnishes-include
interalia starch and chitosan and their derivatives, carboxymethyl cellulose and cyclodextrin as well as ﬁnishes based on nano-inorganic and
nano-organic materials (Hebeish & Guthrie, 2012; Mohamed &
Hassabo, 2015).
The needs to modify the cellulosic fabric with multifunctional
properties such as antibacterial, conductivity and ultraviolet protection
factor (UPF) is essential to be used as a base to design new textile
products such as upholster beds, underwear, and protective clothing.
These forms of products are common in hospitals, medical clinics,
health centres, sportswear and laboratories. The long-lasting antibacterial cotton fabrics reduces the overheads accompanying the
treatment and diagnosis of nosocomial contaminations and post-

infection impediments, thereby help to put stop of hospital infections
(Hebeish, El-Raﬁe, El-Sheikh, Seleem, & El-Naggar, 2014; Shahidi &
Wiener, 2012). In addition, controlling the growth and harmful eﬀect of
microorganism act in form of quality of life means.
Nanotechnology occupies leading positions in development and
innovation in diﬀerent disciplines of human activities (Sharifpour,
Haddadi, Ghaedi, Dashtian, & Asfaram, 2018). It is the science and
technology of processing, characterization, properties and applications
of small –sized materials of dimensions in the range of few nanometres
to less than one hundred nanometres. The interest in particles of these
typical sizes is due to the fact that the magnetic, optical and electrical
properties s as well as their performance towards drug delivery (ElNaggar, Abdelgawad, Salas, & Rojas, 2016; El-Newehy et al., 2016,
2018; Mohamed, Hassabo, Nada, & Zaghlool, 2016; Nada, Hassabo,
Mohamed, Mounier, & Abou Zeid, 2016), wound dressing (Hebeish
et al., 2014), antidiabetic (Hussein, El-Bana, Refaat, & El-Naggar,
2017), antitumor (Medhat et al., 2017), UV radiation (Beura &
Thangadurai, 2018; El-Naggar, Shaarawy, & Hebeish, 2018) and antibacterial activity (Hebeish, Shaarawy, Hassabo, & El-Shafei, 2016;

2016; Shaheen, El-Naggar, Abdelgawad, & Hebeish, 2016). Such preparation is carried out in presence of either Polymethylol Compound
(PMC) or functionalized polyethyleneimine (FPEI) polymers which can
be act as both reductant and stabilizing agents for the as synthesized
nanoparticles. Additionally, these polymers with very small concentration has great ability to undergo bounding to the cellulose molecules of cotton fabrics and hence, enhance the un-leaching of these
nanoparticles during washing cycles.
With the above background in mind, the present work aims to
confer multifunctionalities, viz. antibacterial, ultraviolet protection and
conductivity, on cotton fabrics using a versatile approach. So far, no
technique is yet published for modiﬁcation of cotton fabrics to render
them multifunctional in one-step process. In current work, eﬀorts are
made to establish preparation of AgNPs, ZnONPs and CuNPs using FPEI
or PMC via the formation and stabilization of these particles in one
bath. Synthesis of CuNPs necessitates the presence of ascorbic acid as
antioxidant for CuNPs. Characterization of the three metallic nanoparticles independently synthesized vis-à-vis their mates formed in the
molecular structure of cotton using one – step method are achieved. To
this end, the research work was completed through evaluation of antibacterial, ultraviolet protection and conductivity properties after
washing cycles.

Mohamed, El-Naggar, Shaheen, & Hassabo, 2016; Saikia, Sarmah,
Bordoloi, Gogoi, & Goswamee, 2018) are diﬀerent and always much
better than those of the bulk materials (Ju-Nam & Lead, 2008; Khan,
Saeed, & Khan, 2017). It was reported that the multifunctional fabrics
can be fabricated using nanocomposites of synthetic polymers loaded
with metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, clay compounds or
muti-walled carbon nanotubes (Alimohammadi, Gashti, & Mozaﬀari,
2018; Ebrahimi & Gashti, 2016, 2018; Gashti & Eslami, 2015; Gashti &
Gashti, 2013; Parvinzadeh Gashti, Rashidian, Almasian, & Badakhshan
Zohouri, 2013).
The most rapidly growing ﬁeld of nanotechnology is the use of
nanoparticles that are promising alternatives to conventional materials
(Salata, 2004; Seil & Webster, 2012). It is well known that the activities
of these nanomaterials greatly rely on their size and shapes (Seil &
Webster, 2012; Shi, Qi, Ma, & Cheng, 2003). As a result, it is crucial to
propose simplistic green method to prepare these nanomaterials as well
as a facile technique for their application to cotton fabrics along with
long -lasting actions. On the other hand, besides keeping the uniform
size, shape and the eﬃcient method for preparation as well under
control, it is worthy to make sure that the manufacturing route and
application to textile fabrics is an eﬃcient process in timesaving, costeﬀective and energy too. There are numbers of both physical and
chemical methodologies that have been established for fabricating
metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (Agarwal, Kumar, & Rajeshkumar,
2017; Stankic, Suman, Haque, & Vidic, 2016). The physical methods
(laser ablation and radiolysis) involve expensive instruments and consume large amounts of energy. These methods are typically making use
of agents which are both toxic and environmentally polluting (Zain,
Stapley, & Shama, 2014). Nevertheless, taking the cost-eﬀective and
environmental factors into our thoughtfulness, the methods based on
chemical approach is considered as the best opportunity for preparation
and application of the nano-sized metal and metal oxide nanoparticles.
Of these metal and metal oxide nanoparticles include, interalia
silver nanopartticles (AgNPs), zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs),
Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and that have received noteworthy and
extensive thoughtfulness from global researchers and scientists due to
their unique antibacterial, conductivity and UPF properties (Hossain &
Rahman, 2015). AgNPs have been synthesized using water as a solvent
and benign natural polymer as both capping and reducing agent (ElNaggar, Shaheen, Fouda, & Hebeish, 2016; Hebeish, Shaheen, & ElNaggar, 2016). This preparation is demonstrated to have advantages
over conventional methods involving chemical agents that are associated with environmental toxicity (Hebbalalu, Lalley, Nadagouda, &
Varma, 2013). CuNPs currently attract signiﬁcant research attention
because of their widespread use in smart textile to acquire enhancement
the conductivity of the fabricated textile. Although production of
CuNPs using chemical reduction method gives good results. However,
the as prepared CuNPs is being readily oxidized in air and aqueous
solutions (Dharsana, Varsha, Behlol, Veerappan, & Thiagarajan, 2015).
To overcome this, a very small amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has
been added to protect the resultant CuNPs against oxidation without
much agglomeration (Xiong, Wang, Xue, & Wu, 2011). The process of
preparation and application becomes also more economical, saving
time, nontoxic and more safety (Dang, Le, Fribourg-Blanc, & Dang,
2011; Xiong et al., 2011). The conductivity properties of Cu in nano
form scale is greater than that of Cu in its bulky form. On the other side,
metal oxides nanoparticles such as ZnONPs is a fascinating material
because of its exceptional physical and chemical properties such as high
chemical and mechanical stability (Xia et al., 2012), a broad range of
radiation absorption, high catalysis activity, nontoxic nature etc.
The preparation of these nanoparticles of Ag, ZnO and Cu in one
bath containing cotton fabric induces the cotton fabrics with extraordinary properties such as antibacterial, UPF and conductivity. The
said preparation is accompanied by decreasing the cost of production
and the environmental pollution (El-Naggar, Shaarawy, & Hebeish,
2018a, 2018b; El-Naggar, Shaheen, Zaghloul, El-Raﬁe, & Hebeish,

2. Materials and methods

2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Modiﬁcation of polyethyleneimine (PEI)
Functionalized polyethyleneimine compound (FPEI) containing
amine and methylol groups was synthesized by the reaction of paraformaldehyde with primary amine group (25%) of PEI in a mixture kept
under stirring for 8 h at 75 °C. Thereafter, the ﬁnal product was kept
under reduced pressure using rotary evaporator to remove the excess
water and unreacted materials with subsequently production of FPEI
(Guo, An, Xiao, Zhai, & Shi, 2017; Hassabo, Mohamed, Shaarawy, &

Malvern instruments Ltd., UK) at 25 °C using UV Grade cuvettes after
treatment in an ultrasonic water bath (Model LBS2, FALC Instruments
S.R.I. Italy) for 30 min to break up any aggregates present. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
The surface morphology of the cotton fabrics treated with nanoparticles was studied using SEM (JEOL JSM-5310). SEM micrographs
were obtained at magniﬁcations 7500 & 15,000. Energy dispersive Xray technique (EDX) connected to SEM instrument was also done to
verify the presence of elemental silver, zinc and copper as well as
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the analyzed samples.
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns of ﬁnely prepared powder was recorded on a Philips PW 3050/10 diﬀractometer by monitoring the
diﬀraction angle from 5° to 80° (2θ). The diﬀractometer was controlled
and operated by a PC computer with the programs P Roﬁt and used
aMoK (source with wavelength 0.70930 A°, operating with Mo-tube
radiation at 50 kV and 40 mA. Crystallite size of the synthesized nanoparticles was calculated using full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the 100% peak of nanoparticles using Scherrer’s formula,

under stirring. To this end, polyamine compound I (PAC) was produced.
In a subsequent step, formaldehyde (6.5 mol, 195 g, freshly prepared by
heating paraformaldehyde in water at pH 8–9 using NaHCO3) was
added to PAC and the mixture formed thereof was kept under stirring
for 480 min at 50 °C (Fraenkel-Conrat & Olcott, 1948; Kamel, Kharadly,
Shakra, & Youssef, 1990; Koga, Imoto, Yasuyuki, Shinichi, & Yagishita,
1978; Vail, Moran, & Moore, 1962). The ﬁnal product was kept under
reduced pressure using rotary evaporator to remove the excess water
and unreacted materials. Subsequently compound II (PMC) was produced.
2.2.3. Preparation of cotton fabrics treated with metal/metal oxide
nanoparticles
The chemical synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles
loaded cotton fabrics have been performed using PMC and FPEI as
stabilizing as well as reducing agent. This chemical preparation can be
described as follows:
In the ﬁrst step, 2 g of PMC or FPEI were dissolved in 98 ml of
distilled water and kept in a water bath under magnetic stirring at 60 °C
for 15 min. The pH of reaction media was maintained at 11 using
0.001 M of NaOH. After complete dissolution of PMC or FPEI, 0.01 g of
AgNO3 dissolved in 2 ml of H2O is added with raising the temperature
to 80 °C with continuous magnetic stirring. After complete addition,
three samples of cotton fabrics were immersed to the previous solution
with continuous stirring in a water bath for 15 min. To this, the three
samples were removed from the solution. One of these three samples
coded as PMC-A or FPEI-A for the sample treated with AgNPs that was
formed and stabilized with PMC or FPEI respectively. Samples was removed, dried, cured and kept for further characterization.
In the second step, the volume of the rest solution was supplemented by fresh distilled water to attain 100 ml. To this solution of
PMC-AgNPs or FPEI-AgNPs, 0.5 g of Zn(NO3)2 in 2 ml of H2O was
added. After complete homogeneity, the two pieces of cotton fabrics
treated previously with PMC- AgNPs or FPEI-AgNPs was immersed
again in this solution and kept under shaking for another 15 min at
80 °C. Subsequently, the treated two samples were removed and one of
them was symbolized as PMC-AZ or FPEI-AZ. for the sample treated
with PMC/AgNPs/Zn(NO3)2 or FPEI/AgNPs/Zn(NO3)2 respectively.
In the ﬁnal step, the volume of treated solution of PMC-AZ or FPEIAZ was supplemented again with distilled water to attain 100 ml. After
raising the temperature of these solutions to 80 °C, 0.5 g of Cu(NO3)2
dissolved in 2 ml of H2O was added to the mixture solution with continuous shaking followed by the addition of 0.01 g ascorbic acid as antioxidizing agent to prevent the reverse reactions and to inhibit the
oxidation of the formed CuNPs. The mixture was left under shaking for
15 min at 80 °C. Followed by the immersion of the rest sample of cotton
fabric treated with PMC/AgNPs/ Zn(NO3)2 or FPEI/AgNPs/Zn(NO3)2
for 15 min. To this end, the treated sample was removed from the solution and labelled PMC-AZC or FPEI-AZC. All treated fabrics obtained
from the three steps were washed and rinsed with water, dried at 80 °C
for 3 min and cured at 130 °C for 2 min.

H NMR spectra of the samples were obtained on a Bruker AC 300/P
spectrometer, using the CP–MAS technique. The antibacterial activities
of treated fabrics was quantitatively evaluated against both gram-positive bacteria (S. aurous) and gram-negative bacteria (E. coli)
(Mohamed, El-Naggar, Shaheen, & Hassabo, 2017). Assessment of antibacterial ﬁnishes on treated fabrics was carried out according to
AATCC test method 100–2012 (AATCC Test Method (100-2012), 2012).
The bacteriostatic activity was evaluated after 24 h and percent reduction of bacteria calculated using the following equation:

R %= ⎡
⎣

A−B
⎤ × 100
A ⎦

(1)

where R = the reduction rate, A = the number of bacterial colonies
from untreated fabrics, and B = the number of bacterial colonies from
treated fabrics.
The durability of the treated cotton fabrics containing metal and
metal oxide nanoparticles against bacterial activity was performed before and after repeated washing cycles (5, 10 and 20 cycles).
Laundering was done using warm water containing non-ionic wetting
agent (0.5 g/l). Each laundering time was 45 min followed by drying at
70 °C. Electrical conductivity (Adwa apparatus) is employed to measurement the conductivity of the treated cotton fabrics with these nanoparticles. Static water contact angle was measured at atmospheric
conditions (25 °C).
The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of untreated and treated
fabrics were measured by the Australian/New Zealand standard (AS/
NZS 4366-1996) using UV–vis spectrophotometer. The control reference was measured as air. UPF was calculated from the transmission
spectra of the fabrics in the scope of 280–400 nm (Becheri, Dürr, Lo
Nostro, & Baglioni, 2008; El-Naggar, Hassabo, Mohamed, & Shaheen,
2017) using the following equation:

2.3. Characterisation
Formation of AgNPs was monitored using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 100 UV–vis, Agilent Co., Italy. The particles
shape and their distribution for metal/metal oxide nanoparticles was
noticed via using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL
(JEM-1230; Japan) instrument with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.
Samples containing nanoparticles were brieﬂy centrifuged at 4500 rpm
for 10 min to pellet any large clumps of nanoparticles as these could
damage the grids when in the electron beam. The sample was drop-cast
onto carbon coated grid. Excess sample was removed by blotting paper
and the grid was left to air-dry.
The particle sizes of AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/
CuNPs were measured using a Zeta sizer instrument (Nano-Sizer SZ90,

spectrophotometric experiments and Δ(λ) is the diﬀerence between
measurable wavelength.
Standard deviation (STD) is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values (Bland & Altman, 1996). A low
standard deviation value meaning that, the data is close to the mean
(expected value) of the reading values, while a high standard deviation
meaning that the data set are spread out over a wider range of values.

surface of cotton fabrics together with AgNPs and Zn(OH)2. Cotton
fabrics treated with AgNPs, Zn(OH)2 and CuNPs are submitted to drying
and curing to gain AgNPs, ZnONPs and CuNPs deposited on and penetrated within the surface of cotton fabrics.
The expected reactions between cotton surface and coated nanoparticles would occur as described in Scheme 2. Etheriﬁcation reaction
between hydroxyl group from the methylol group in FPEI or PMC and
hydroxyl group of the molecular structure of cotton cellulose would
take place. This reaction makes the polymer matrix with metal and
metal oxide nanoparticles ﬁxed on the cotton surface with covalent
bond as presented in the schematic illustration shown under. This
scheme (Scheme 2) is self-explanatory and useful to clarify the reactions
occurring in particular those between the nanoparticles and the cotton
cellulose.
It is clear from the photographic images, Fig. 1, that there is a
change of color because of the treatment. The blank sample, white in
color, was treated with PMC or FPEI with no color change. The color
turned yellow when the samples was treated with AgNPs. Further
treatment with ZnONPs the color changed to pale yellow as a result of
ZnO deposition (white in color) on the surface of cotton fabric treated
with AgNPs. Finally, the fabrics were treated with CuNPs to produce the
blue colored samples.

3. Result and discussion
Concerns of the synthesis of metal nanoparticles impose the use of
reducing agent to convert the metal ion to metal atom. Of equal importance is the use of stabilizing agents to prevent agglomeration/aggregation of the as formed nanoparticles. It has been shown the polymethylol compound (PMC) and functionalized polethyleneimine (FPEI)
act in favor of metal nanoparticles formation on the surface of cotton
fabric. Scheme 1 represent the chemical reaction and the chemical
formula for the formation of PMC using PAC as precursor.

52.4 (C-6/13) and 36.4 (C-3/16/20/24/28/32) ppm
On the other hand, Compound II (PMC) as shown in Scheme 1B:
Chemical formula: C24H48N10O6, M. wt.: 572.71 g/mol, elemental analysis: C: 48.35%; H: 9.09%; N: 16.54% and O: 26.02%. 1H NMR (CDCl3,

Hence, the as prepared PMC and FPEI compounds are capable of
reducing metal ions eﬃciently and stabilizing the nanoparticles formed
thereof. Complexation of trimetallic nanoparticles, i.e. AgNPs/ZnONPs/
CuNPs to the molecular structures of cotton through inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can be eased owing to the numerous hydroxyl groups of PMC and FPEI. The ultimate eﬀect of this complexation is to prevent the aggregation of these nanoparticles.
Experimentally, addition of AgNO3 to PMC or to FPEI polymeric materials results in reduction of Ag ions to AgNPs under the inﬂuence of
reducing groups located within the structure of either PMC or FPEI
polymer. Addition of Zn(NO3)2 to the alkaline solution of polymer
loaded with AgNPs yields zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)2).
The latter, in a subsequent step, are presented and deposited into
the surface of cotton fabrics along with AgNPs. The last step involves
addition of Cu(NO3)2 that is reduced and converts to CuNPs in presence
of ascorbic acid. During the synthesis process, presence of ascorbic acid
is necessary to avoid the oxidation of CuNPs to copper oxides. The
antioxidant property of ascorbic acid is associated with its ability to
scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules that accompany
the donation of electrons to yield semi anhydroscorbate radicals and
dehydroascorbic acid.
Being handled in the same manner, CuNPs are deposited on the

3.1. Characterization of currently synthesized nanoparticles
3.1.1. UV–vis spectra of AgNPs formed and stabilized via PMC or FPEI
UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy is nowadays considered a very
useful tool and plausible technique for studying metal nanoparticles
because the peak position and shapes are sensitive to particle size. Thus
during the synthesis of AgNPs in aqueous solution, the UV–vis spectra
of their samples were recorded and the graphs are shown in Fig. 2.
The plasmon properties of the nanoparticles were measured by
UV–vis spectrometry (Varian Cary 50, USA), as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, PMC or FPEI display no speciﬁc peaks. After addition of silver
nitrate solution, the maximum surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of
the AgNPs stabilized by PMC or FPEI nanocomposites – coded as PMC-A
and FPEI-A was determined and found to be around 410–415 nm. The
appearance of these peaks conﬁrmed the successful synthesis of AgNPs
stabilized by PMC or FPEI chains (Abdelgawad, El-Naggar, Eisa, &
Rojas, 2017).
3.1.2. Determination of particles shape and hydrodynamic size of the
formed AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs
TEM analysis is established as a reliable technique to monitor the
size and shape of nanoparticles. Fig. 3(A, C and E) illustrates the particle size and shape of AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/
CuNPs formed and stabilized by PMC compound respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 3(B, D and F) exhibits the as synthesized AgNPs, AgNPs/
ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs after being reduced and stabilized
by FPEI compound.
AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs are of low
polydispersity nature and having spherical morphology as shown in
Fig. 4. These nanoparticles are also well separated from each other most
probably due to the presence of stabilizing groups in the PMC and FPEI
molecules. The average size of the so synthesized nanoparticles is
around 20 nm. It is further seen that the nanoparticles can assume two
phases and three phases depending on the number of combined nanoparticles whether they are two or three nanoparticles.
The average hydrodynamic size of the as synthesized monometallic
(AgNPs), bimetallic AgNPs/CuNPs and trimetallic (AgNPs/ZnONPs/
CuNPs) stabilized by PMC or FPEI polymers was measured using DLS
and the resultant graphs are presented in Fig. 4(A and B). As is evident
the average particle sizes of AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/
ZnONPs/CuNPs stabilized by PMC are 16, 23 and 24 nm respectively.
On the other hand, the particle size for the nanoparticles stabilized with
FPEI molecules are 10, 21 and 50 nm respectively. When PMC is used as

stabilizer. The diﬀerence in size as observed from TEM and DLS analysis
is attributed to the presence of water molecules on the surface of the
nanoparticles. Assuming that a hydration layer is surrounding the
particle, the measured diameter from the particle’s diﬀusional properties indicates the size of the solvated particle, which is called the

reducing and stabilizing agent, the size of AgNPs is very small and insigniﬁcantly enlarged when coated with ZnONPs and CuNPs.
The reverse is the case with Ag/ZnO/CuNPs where its size is signiﬁcantly increases to 50 nm when compared with the size of AgNPs
and AgNPs/ZnONPs prepared using FPEI as reductant as well as

were deposited on the fabric surface. Then fabric treated with AgNPs
was immersed in FPEI or PMC solution containing ZnONPs and the rest
of AgNPs. To this, fabric treated with AgNPs and ZnONPs was immersed
in FPEI or PMC solution containing CuNPs and the rest of both AgNPs
and ZnONPs. After being so treated, the fabrics were dried and cured.

3.2. Characterization of the formed metal and metal oxide nanoparticles
formed in the molecular structure of cotton fabrics

3.2.2. Morphological examination of metallic nanoparticles containing
cotton fabrics
In order to eﬀect cotton ﬁnishing, the cotton fabric is ﬁrstly immersed in a solution of PMC or PEI followed by raising the temperature
then solution of AgNO3 and Zn(NO3)2 are added. Thereafter, given
solution of Cu(NO3)2 is added to the previous solution. Hence. we have
three samples of cotton fabrics treated with AgNPs, Ag/ZnONPs and
Ag/ZnO/CuNPs formed and stabilized by PMC molecules and other
three samples of cotton fabrics that are formed and stabilized with

3.2.1. Preparation of cotton fabrics treated with metal/metal oxide
nanoparticles
As described above in the experimental section, cotton fabrics were
submitted to treatment with AgNPs, ZnONPs and CuNPs coated and
stabilized with FPEI or PMC molecules. At the beginning, fabric was
treated with AgNPs coated with FPEI or PMC, whereby these particles

fabrics loaded with the synthesized AgNPs, Ag/ZnONPs and Ag/ZnO/
CuNPs; these nanoparticles are formed and stabilized by PMC polymer.
On the other hand, the cotton fabrics containing FPEI formed and stabilized of AgNPs, Ag/ZnONPs and Ag/ZnO/CuNPs are displayed in
Fig. 6.
After treatments, the adsorbed nanoparticles are observed on the
surface of cotton fabrics. The as prepared nanoparticles are observed to
be located in the inter-ﬁber spaces, beside that the nanoparticles are
attached to the ﬁbers. It can be clearly that the size of the deposited
nanoparticles is very small with spherical shapes. The higher adsorption
of the formed nanocomposite stabilized by PMC or FPEI compound
could be ascribed to the comparatively small size without noticeable
aggregation as observed in the SEM images. The high adsorption of
nanoparticles may be attributed to the high aﬃnity of the two polymers
(PMC, FPEI) loaded with nanoparticles toward cellulosic molecules.
The elemental analysis of nanocomposites deposited onto and inside
the cotton fabrics is performed using an EDX elemental analysis
equipped with an SEM instrument. The results obtained are shown in
Fig. 5 for Ag, Ag/ZnO and Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposites stabilized via
PMC chains. On the other hand, Fig. 6 exhibits the elements of cotton
fabrics treated with FPEI stabilized Ag, Ag/ZnO and Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposites. The peaks for zinc, copper, and silver in their respective
positions indicated the presence of these elements in the hybrids. In
case of cotton fabric, treated with PMC stabilized Ag, Ag/ZnO, Ag/ZnO/
Cu nanocomposite, the peaks for Ag, Zn, and Cu are approximately
around 2.8, 1.2 and 1.1 KeV, respectively in addition to the peak of N of
PMC at 0.4 Kev. The peak intensity indicates the relative concentration
of each element in the nanocomposite hybrid containing cotton fabric
and provided information on the percentage of metallic nanoparticles
attached to the surface of the cotton fabric. The same holds true for
samples of cotton fabrics treated with FPEI stabilized Ag, Ag/ZnO, Ag/
ZnO/Cu nanocomposite.
Obviously, then, the EDX analysis conﬁrms that the samples of
cotton fabrics containing PMC stabilized Ag, Ag/ZnO, Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposite displays value of approximately 2.06, 3.02 and 5.39%
respectively. On the other hand, the weight percent of Ag, Ag/ZnO, Ag/
ZnO/Cu nanocomposite stabilized via PEI chains is around 2.06, 5.56
and 7.12% respectively. Current results speak of the successful synthesis of Ag, Ag/ZnO, Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposite coated cotton fabrics.

observed 2 θ values 31° (100), 34° (002) and relatively weak at 56°
(110) (Bonadonna et al., 1996).
It is detected that there is marginally broader peak at 44° corresponding the typical diﬀraction angle of fcc Ag, which can be indexed
to the (200) plane. In addition, there is no notable shift of all diﬀraction
peaks in the samples signifying that the change of the lattice parameters
of ZnO nanoparticles should be insigniﬁcant.
In the XRD patterns of cotton fabric containing PMC and FPEI
coated Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposites, the broad and small peaks at 2
θ = 42° and 49°, correspond to the cubic (fcc) Cu (JCPDS No. 04-0836),
respectively. Whilst the other peaks have nearly similar diﬀraction
peaks as seen for Ag/ZNO nanocomposites. The diﬀraction pattern for
Ag, ZnO and Cu nanoparticles produce through physical mixture of

Presence of other elements such as C and O originated from graphs are
also identiﬁed which are originated from cotton cellulose of fabrics,
FPEI and PMC compound.

3.2.3. Determination of the composition and crystal phase of cotton fabrics
containing the formed metal and metal oxide nanoparticles using XRD tool
In order to examine the changes in the crystal structure of cotton
cellulose caused by incorporation of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, XRD in the range of 2 θ: 5–80° is used for the cotton fabrics
containing each of the two polymers (i.e. PMC or FPEI) capped Ag, Ag/
ZNO and Ag/ZnO/Cu nanocomposites respectively.
Fig. 7 displays the typical XRD patterns of pure ZnO (JCPDS 361451) and Ag-ZnO (JCPDS 04-0783) nanoparticles. On the core of the
XRD results, the crystallographic phase of the ZnO and Ag-ZnO goes to

metal salts comprises intense sharp and broad peaks, which is an evidence of crystallinity together with amorphous signal.
Calculated average crystallite sizes are illustrated in Table 1 for the
synthesized three nanoparticles using both PMC and FPEI. The illustrated data provide that, synthesized AgNPs size using both polymer be
in range from 6.62 to 6.94 nm.
On the other hand, the calculated particle size of the nanoparticles
(ZnONPs and CuNPs) are became bigger under the XRD curve, which
may be attributed to the accumulation of the nanoparticles (because of
the used technique). That because at beginning AgNPs used most of the
functional groups in reducing agent, then at the second step, the second

3.2.6. Evaluation of the UPF factor for treated fabrics
The eﬃciency of the aforementioned treated fabrics for ultra-violet
protection (UPF) is determined. Fig. 8 shows the UPF values of cotton
fabric containing AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs
stabilized by PMC or FPEI polymers. It is evident that cotton fabrics
sample containing ZnONPs displays good UPF values than untreated
cotton sample and cotton sample containing AgNPs. It is also evident
that cotton fabrics containing nanoparticles stabilized by PMC have
higher UPF values than those stabilized by FPEI. Largely, all modiﬁcations of cotton fabrics under the inﬂuence of the formation and
stabilization of the trimetallic nanoparticles (AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs)
induce favourable impact on UPF values. It is reported (El-Naggar et al.,
2017; Ibrahim et al., 2017) that UPF of UV-protected garment should be
at least 40-50. Accordingly, all samples containing FPEI or PMC along
with ZnONPs are having good UPF.

nanoparticles is accumulated on the previous one. In addition, the XRD
characteristic peaks for the three nanoparticles are so close to each
other, so, the calculated size is characteristic; in our case; to the total
number of nanoparticle. In addition, it is clear that, using FPEI as reducing agent provide small nanoparticles than using PMC.
3.2.4. Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of treated fabrics
Culture count method against two types of bacteria E. coli and S.
aureus was used to determine the antibacterial activity of treated cotton
fabrics. The latter include fabrics containing the formed metal and/or
metal oxide nanoparticles stabilized by either PMC or FPEI polymers.
The antibacterial activity was monitored before and after diﬀerent
washing cycle (5, 10, 15 and 20 cycles) and the result obtained are set
out in Table 2.
It is seen that all cotton fabrics containing metal and/or metal oxide
nanoparticles display excellent antibacterial activity. The bacterial reduction percent is decreases by increasing the washing cycle and the
reduction attains signiﬁcant decrement after ﬁve washing cycles.
However, the bacterial reduction remains excellent around 90% of
killing bacteria species even after 20 washing cycles. It is noted from
Table 1 that, S. aureus reduction became lower than E. coli before and
after washing cycles.
It is further demonstrated that, fabrics under monitoring have relatively high antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (E.
coli) than gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus). The highly antibacterial
properties of E. coli than S. aureus could be attributed to the diﬀerence
in structure and compositions of the cell walls of bacteria. Such difference is related to the fact that S. aureus acquire thicker layer of
peptidoglycan than E. coli. This thickness causes decrement in the
magnitude of penetration of the nanoparticles into gram-positive bacteria (Hassabo, Nada, Ibrahim, & Abou-Zeid, 2015), thereby decreasing
the antibacterial activity of the cotton containing these nanoparticles.
i.e. increasing reduction percent of bacteria.

3.2.7. Conductivity measurements of cotton fabrics containing metal and
metal oxide nanoparticles
Conductive fabrics has developed in medical ﬁelds (telemedicine,
bio-monitoring and sport medicine) as well. Therefore, the conductive
fabric allows the observing of patient throughout prolonged period.
Electrical conductivity σ (S) of untreated cotton fabric and cotton
fabrics containing trimetallic nanoparticles through the formation of
AgNPs, AgNPs/ZnONPs and AgNPs/ZnONPs/CuNPs stabilized by FPEI
or PMC was measured. The measurements are carried out using fabric
thickness at ambient room temperature (25 °C). From the data in Fig. 9,
It is obviously the conductivity of the metal and metal oxide nanoparticles containing fabrics are around 10−5 Ω−1 m−1, which is greater
than that of the untreated cotton (4.3 × 10−12 Ω−1 m−1).
The results of Fig. 9 signify that, each of the modiﬁed cotton fabrics
displays higher electrical conductivity than does the untreated cotton
fabric. In addition, presence of the three metal nanoparticles all-together on the surface of cotton fabric make the fabric more conductive.
As shown in Fig. 9 increasing and diﬀerentiating the metal points on the
surface of cotton fabric lead substantial increase in the electrical conductivity. Furthermore, electrical conductivity of cotton fabrics modiﬁed through the formation of nanoparticles along with their stabilization using PMC as higher than upon using FPEI for the same purposes

3.2.5. Contact angle and wettability measurements
Examination of the treated fabrics surface through measuring the
contact angle and wettability time have done and the data presented in
Table 3. Contact angle values and wettability time provide that, treated
fabrics with both polymer FPEI or PMC enhance the hydrophobicity of
the fabric, which portably due to that, the fabric surface was coated
with ﬁlm, which ﬁll the cavity on the surface and the fabric surface
become more smoothing, and fabrics become able to be water resistance.

4. Conclusion
Antibacterial activity, ultraviolet protection and conductivity
properties were concomitantly conferred on cotton fabrics through the
conversion of metal salts to metallic nanoparticle. Metal salts include

AgNO3, Zn(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 were used as precursor for nanoparticles formation using one of the following two innovative polymeric; FPEI and PMC. As per their chemical nature, FPEI or PMC would
undergo three main functions: (1) reducing the metal cations to metal
atoms and metal clusters, (2) stabilizing the nanoparticles against aggregation and (3) holding the nanoparticles by covalent bonding
through establishment of crosslinked network involving the molecular
structure of cotton cellulose of the targeted fabrics. Cotton fabrics
containing one, two and three metallic nanoparticles were prepared by
immersing these fabrics in aqueous solution containing FPEI/AgNO3,
FPEI/AgNO3/Zn(NO3)2, FPEI/AgNO3/Zn(NO3)2/Cu(NO3)2 or PMC/
AgNO3, PMC/AgNO3/ Zn(NO3)2, PMC/AgNO3/Zn(NO3)2/Cu(NO3)2
while stirring for certain duration. All these chemically processed
cotton samples were washed and rinsed with water and dried at 80 C
and cured at 130 °C for 2 min. Fabrics underwent structural changes
during their treatments as per the designed practice exhibit multifunctional properties and manifold performance. They reveal changes
in morphology, crystalline structure, in addition to the antibacterial
properties, ultra-violet properties and excellent conductivity.
